The current crisis with the rising NPAs in the banking sector is being used as another opportunity to overhaul the banking system. With years of propaganda of an inefficient public sector, a climate of disinvestment is only perfect to liquidate any public sector financial institution! Hence what we are facing today is not just an NPA crisis is a conscious effort to reverse the nationalisation of banks and to end public sector.\n \nThe combination of merging small banks to create a few \u2018lending giants\u2019 along with the introduction of payment banks is a perfect way to end brick and mortar branches. The proposals of \u2018haircuts\u2019(a fancy term for write-offs,) the policy of demonetisation, evergreening of loans, selling bad loans at a pittance to asset reconstruction companies are all measures that would further weaken the public sector banks.  A slew of legislation on banking sector, in the form of, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 and the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017 were introduced in haste and without a debate in order to make the PSBs weak and subservient. Particularly the FRDI puts most of the PSBs under the threat of being liquidated.\n \nBanks apart, the entire public sector is facing disinvestment, privatisation, and selling of assets and resources in the name of cutting losses.

It is a unique opportunity to immerse in the teachings of Osho through his discourse.\n\nOsho had a saying about White Robe gatherings -\u201cThat which cannot be said has to be experienced. This is a great experience of getting into the inner space. Something is experienced in this gathering which no one has been able to define. It\u2019s the peak of all day of work, meditation or groups.\u201d\n\nThe gathering starts with some pre-work activities, to help participants settle down, leave behind the chaos of the city and check in to the here and now. From there, everybody is invited to participate and dance with totality, better so we are able to sit silently afterwards in the ambience of intermittent music. Following the sitting, a short discourse by Osho commences in which we absorb and internalise Osho\u2019s words.\n\nDo come freshly showered with no perfume. White robes will be provided for the evening at the venue for you to change into for the gathering.\n\nFacilitator : Prem Bhakti, Ashwin Bharti &amp; Swami Dhyaan Sangeetam\n\nBhakti has been trained as a leader of social meditations from the Osho Humaniversity in Netherlands. She has been a meditation leader and yoga instructor with Zorba the Buddha for almost 2 years. Bhakti is a certified clinical hypnotherapist since 1997; she has received yoga initiation and training from renowned institutions like Bihar School of Yoga, Sivananda Yoga Center and Kaivalyadham. As a life coach she has been instrumental in supporting and guiding people in their journey towards self-discovery.\n\nAshwin Bharti became a disciple of Osho in 1977 and is an ambassador of Osho\u2019s vision. From being a successful businessman, he became a philanthropist and started helping himself &amp; others in their spiritual journey. Being a channel for Osho\u2019s energy, Ashwin created Zorba the Buddha, one of the world\u2019s largest open faith spiritual centre and cultural hub. Over the years, he has received transmissions from various teachers in Sufism, Tantra, Zen, Shamanism, Pulsing, Osho therapies &amp; meditations, bodywork, biodanza, contact improvisation, art and music. Today, Ashwin continues to live his vision of bringing people to meditation as well as celebration, and has been facilitating Osho meditations for more than a decade.\n\nSwami Dhyaan Sangeetam is a student of compassion, meditation, and musical celebration. His previous lifetime as a high-flying corporate employee led him to suffer a heart attack at the age of 29. Following that event, he began responding to a spiritual calling, traveling extensively and expanding his life through meditation practices and supporting others in their own growth, freedom, and discovery of their spiritual being through his music.\nFounder of the Djembe Fola United, his Rainbow and Drum circles are truly unique and potent in awakening the spirit of celebration and potential for inner healing. For the past couple years, his gifted passion for percussion and community resonance has been inviting people from all walks of life to experience and express love &amp; consciousness. His journey of self-discovery led him to the Osho International Festival held at Zorba the Buddha in 2016, where he felt deep resonance with Osho\u2019s work. He has been with the Zorba community since then, as a Sanyasi and resident facilitator, conducting morning and evening meditations and offering his exuberant energy and wisdom to all those who walk in. He considers himself gifted and fortunate to be able to support and assist people on their life journey towards optimal health, enlightenment, and ultimate freedom.\n\nDate &amp; Timing : 1st, 8th, 22nd, 29th Nov, 2017 (5.45 PM \u2013 7.30 PM)\n\n(Every Wednesday)\n\nContact : Tamanna\nPhone : +91 9654322882\nEmail : joy | zorbathebuddha ! org\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "OSHO Satsang - A White Robe Gathering", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/osho-satsang-a-white-robe-gathering/153828918689489", "address": "Zorba the Buddha, 7, Tropical Drive road, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Rd, Ghitorni, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/f515e26408f638f8c96de70a7c1cbb66"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/zorba-the-buddha/399540", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/103251593067938/picture?type=large", "events_count": "23", "name": "Zorba The Buddha", "followers_count": "1310"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-11-29 17:45:00", "end": "2017-11-27 19:30:00"}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.497547686178", "longitude": "77.147927284241"}},

I came into being as I came into being. I grew as I grew. I changed as I change. My mind is fire, my soul fire. The cobra wakes and spits fire in my eyes. I rise through ochre smoke into black air enclosed in a shower of stars. I am what I have made. I am the seed of every god, beautiful as evening, hard as light. I am the last four days of yesterday, four screams from the edges of earth \u2013 beauty, terror, truth, madness \u2013 the Phoenix on his pyre.\u201d*\n\nShamanic Vision proudly presents a Three Day, non-residential retreat about New Beginnings that will change your Life forever: Becoming a Phoenix.\n\nDay One shines Light on Our Shadow Selves, where we find Light in the Darkness. Beneath the social mask we wear every day, we have a hidden shadow side: an impulsive, wounded, sad, or isolated part that we generally try to ignore. This hidden side is called The Shadow and it can be a source of emotional richness and vitality, and acknowledging it can be a pathway to healing and living a truthful, authentic life. Here, you will begin delving into the depths of you, building an interactive, lifelong connection with your Soul and your Shadow. Gain profound understanding and awareness in a safe and loving environment. Look beyond the Shadow and find the treasure that hides behind it.\n\nDay Two is about your Inner Child(ren). Learn the \u201cHow to\u201d of Inner Child work while you connect with, and resolve, Inner Child issues.\n\nDay Three is The Day of the Phoenix. Experience and understand the kind of psychological and emotional closure needed before and during death. Based on Shamanic tradition, you will learn the specific steps that bring reconciliation and healing both to the loved ones and to the person dying. Fly away with the message of the Greatest Journey\u2013we can come to the end of a life with grace, entering the journey beyond death to in a peaceful manner, full of Light.\n\nWho should attend this powerful, hands-on workshop?\n\n    Healers of all modalities\u2026\n    Shamanic Practitioners of all levels\u2026\n    Those seeking answers to who they are\u2026\n    Those seeking answers to why are the way they are \u2026\n    Those frightened by the behavior\u2026\n    Those fearful of Death\u2026\n    Those fearful of Living\u2026\n    Those who are ready to Change\u2026\n    Those who want to both live and leave this Life without regret\n\nFor more information and registration details, please visit us at:\n https://shamanic-vision.net/upcoming-workshop-info-registration-phoenix-in-new-delhi/\n\nor write to \n\nneelamnanwani | yahoo ! in\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Become the Phoenix in New Delhi!", "url": "https://allevents.in/south%20east%20delhi/become-the-phoenix-in-new-delhi/2020090741613498", "address": "K 14, Aumtara Spiritual Hub.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     SHAKTIPAT - ENERGY TRANSMISSION EVENT\n\nIt is a process by which a Liberated spiritual teacher with an already awakened Kundalini acts as a vehicle for the transmission of Grace of the cosmic spiritual Kundalini energy into the spiritual aspirant. This powerful energy activates the \u201csleeping\u201d Shakti Kundalini energy, which is stored just below the first chakra. This is not the only way that Kundalini can be awakened, but it is powerful, effective, and considered by many to be the most direct and safe method.\n\nIt is also, historically, a traditional way. Kundalini Shaktipat transmission is referred to in the Torah\u2019s Old Testament in Deuteronomy 34:9 in the passage, \u201cAnd Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand upon him.\u201d In Kabbalah, an accurate term for Shaktipat is S\u2019micha m\u2019shefa or Haniha. In the New Testament, Shaktipat Kundalini transmission is referred to in John 20:22, which says that Jesus \u201cblew upon them and said to them: \u2018Receive Holy Spirit.\" In the Yogic traditions, Shaktipat is a well recognized approach for awakening the Kundalini. It is described in the yogic texts as an initiation that activates an inner unfolding of awareness that leads to higher states of consciousness.\n\nTHE EVENT\n\nThis will be a 7 day intensive course. Kundalini arohan, Cleansing of all 7 chakras during the coming Solstice. The distant transmission will take place 24 x 7 for a week and the final will be given on the day of summer solstice.\n\nThere is a small donation involved as a prerequisite since this is a 7 day course , given with an open heart , it will generate an intent from your side to receive with earnestness, and complete the cycle of exchange.

This 6 day event will feature some of the best dance teachers in the fields of spiritual dance plus individual workshops and special choreography classes in more classical and modern dance styles of with the option to bring these to our final evening Talent Show.\n\nWhat\u2019s more we will be bringing in the New Year in style in this beautifully landscaped oasis with a special party and Sacred Cacao ceremony to set our intentions for 2018 and to really celebrate each other. The following day we will be offering Shamanic Sweat Lodge ceremonies to start a purification into the New Year. Jump into the culture and join us with the Lord of the Dance \u2013 Nataraj!\n\nWORKSHOPS INCLUDE : -\n\nContact Improvisation\n\nAll are welcome to a meditative journey where presence meets creativity. Together we will awake openness, receptivity and softness in the body through movement. Free our capacity of expression, meet ourselves and meet others in a state of presence and empathy.\n\nWe will explore Contact Improvisation through anatomical investigations and partnering exercises therefore enhancing a state of released and effortless motion.  We will also learn how to access intuition and trust, to enable non Verbal Communication and the capacity of Listening through Touch.\n\nEntering in deep connection with our own structure and its intelligence, together being, sensing, creating and transforming in intuitive dance dialogues, traveling on a subtle line where receptivity and intention meet.\n\nWe will awake and integrate the Voice in our dances, tuning, harmonizing and awakening our Voice-Body Instrument. In a choral structure creating harmonies and melodies; touching stillness or movement, listening, connecting to the power of our resonating bodies and inner realities.\n\nPresence Joy and Spontaneity will be our guides!\n\nBiodanza - Dance of Life\n\nAlthough the typical experience of one participating in a biodanza class is that of playfulness, connection, intimacy, dance and joy, the fully vastness of the theoretical model behind biodanza is unlikely (or necessary) to be grasped. The system is more one of experience and its effects are present regardless of the cognitive understanding of what is occurring.\n\nHowever, it is fascinating to realize what is all taken into account within the system, from the neurological, physiological and psychological perspectives, to the mythological archetypes, studies of human movement and musical effects to art, transcendental states and social action.  Biodanza stimulates our genetic potential through various lines of development into its highest expression.\n\n5 Rhythms Workshops\n\n5 Rhythms is a dynamic movement practice\u2014a practice of being in your body\u2014that ignites creativity, connection, and community.\n\nWhile a seemingly simple process, the 5 Rhythms practice facilitates deep and unending explorations, moving the dancer beyond self-imposed limitations and isolation into new depths of creativity and connection.\n\nEach rhythm \u2014 Flowing Staccato Chaos Lyrical Stillness\u2122 \u2014 is interpreted by individuals in a uniquely personal way, opening them to a new sense of freedom and possibility that is both surprising and healing, exhilarating as well as deeply restorative.  It is, in essence, \u201cexercise for the right brain\u201d.\n\nWhen we practice 5 Rhythms, we learn to creatively express aggressiveness and vulnerability, emotions and anxieties, edges and ecstasies. It reconnects us to cycles of birth &amp; death and hooks us into humanity and the spirit of all living things. Within the group context we create connection and community and hone our instincts and our intuitions. We are made up of all walks of life \u2013 every culture, religion, race, gender, age and sexual preference are welcome.\n\n5 Rhythms transcends dance. The movement is the medicine, the meditation and the metaphor. Together we peel back layers, lay masks down, and dance till we disappear.\n\nOnly to rediscover ourselves through it all.\n\nCreative Movement Therapy\n\nExpressive Movement Therapy will explore our unique inner dance and self-expression. Through various movement-based techniques we will engage deeply with our self-identity, the craft of movement and hence enhance our personal integration. It is through this heightened sense of self, we will become empowered enough to reach out to others.\n\nThis creative-therapeutic-expressive movement process will suit a wide range of personalities and body types.\n\nThe workshop will use body preparation exercises, creative movement sequences to music, guided dialogues, dance studies and movement relaxation techniques, to strengthen the body-mind connection and the capacity for effective expression and communication. With their enhanced creativity, problem-solving skills, and renewed capacity for introspection and exploration, participants will emerge equipped for resonant and fruitful daily interactions, as well as the ability to use movement activities &amp; games with other groups of children, adolescents, adults and the elderly.\n\nShamanic Sweat Lodge\n\nSweat lodges are ceremonies of purification and a way to connect humble ourselves from our everyday mind and more deeply to source. In doing so we are able to gain clarity about what really is important and to set our intentions from that place.\n\nForms of these ceremonies have been used by many different native cultures, in many countries and the symbolism, structures and procedures vary but always with an intention of seeking guidance and clarity. The ceremonies I facilitate borrow and connect different symbolism from various traditions but belong to no single tradition, rather they are used as tools to access states of consciousness that are available to all, and deeper than the cultural mind.\n\nCLASSES INCLUDE : -\n\nBelly Dance Classes\n\nThere will be 2 Belly Dance classes which will create a choreography piece for students to perform in the end of festival finale.\n\nLearn this exquisite and beautiful art form from the Middle East. Bellydance is renowned as a sensual and empowering dance form. It is an amazing way of connecting to your sacred feminine and inner diva!\n\nWe will be working on a fun and funky group choreography to perform at the closing show!\n\nAll are welcome, no experience required.\n\nBollywood Dance Classes\n\nBollywood dance is about storytelling. The songs are from the movies and are there for a particular reason- for example, a celebration song, a seduction song, a love song, a song of sadness. So when you dance it out, you are dancing to the words and mood. Different songs are used at different occasions. There are tons of wedding songs, which you will hear being played at every Indian wedding.\n\nContemporary\n\nIn Silence,, There Is Stillness and Also Rhythm\u2026 Everyone has a rhythm.. \u201cThe Heartbeat\u201d\u2026It is The Rhythm of the life.\n\nWe all carry our own beat, it is always there. Life is a Dance, A dance we dance on our own heartbeat.\nListen to the breath. Feel the pulse. Feel the beat. Open our body and open our mind. Allowing the body to move the spirit rise\u2026\nLISTEN / DANCE/ FEEL. Dance , Dance on it, on The Heartbeat.\n\nWhat are we doing\nUsing Contemporary Dance approach, we will have ..\n\n*short excise to listen to the breath / heartbeat/body\n*Fluid movement warm up\n*Slow stretching  movement warm up\n*improvisation movement\n*Contact improvisation\n*emotional approach dance\n*Freedom Improvisation\n* Fun and Beautiful Set Routine.\n\nWho is it for\n\nFor the people who is willing to dance.\nFor the people who is willing to move the body.\nFor the people who is willing to connect with self.\nFor the people to just want to start doing something with the body gently and respectfully.\nFor the people who want to know how to improvise dance and movement.\nFor the people who is willing to listen to the heartbeat and breathing.\n\nBreath Of Life\n\nBreath of Life can help you become aware of and experience each of the seven chakras. This meditation is active in nature and uses deep rapid breathing and body movement, accompanied by musical sounds to open and bring awareness to the chakras. As we breathe deeply into each Chakra, it allows us to connect with our body and charge the chakras with energy. This promotes a vertical connection between all the chakras, and lets the energy flow more easily up and down the spine.\n\nThere are many benefits of practising Breath of Life as it helps us to keep the body moving and the energy flowing. It will enable us to bring silence and vitality into our everyday life. While doing this meditation, one has to be relaxed, remain a witness to whatever is happening, and not judge it.\n\nSoul Dance\n\nCarried by the earth and the soul as you touch the sky\n\nSince thousands of years the dance was a connection to the original source, to the source of yourself.\n\nI take you on a journey to this source, a journey to your soul, feeling the elements of earth, water, air and fire, feeling different qualities, sometimes slowly and tender, sometimes wild and dynamic, sometimes opening and bordering, always in a safe sacred space.\n\nYou are invited in deep experience enjoyed by yourself, with a partner and the whole group. You will make the experience going to deep emotions and to get to know you completely new. You will make the experience to feel connected with the universe through yourself and the others.\n\n\u201clet yourself be carried by the earth and the soul as you touch the sky.\u201d\n\nEVENTS INCLUDE : -\n\nNew Year Eve 2018\n\nWe aim to bring 2018 in with a bang!\n\nTo do so we will have some a Sacred Ceremony and intention setting with Cacao,  Spectacular Performances, Superfood &amp; Smoothies bar,  late night DJs and a special themed Temple.\n\nEvenings will include special dance performances and also the Nataraj Lounge with musicians playing live. What\u2019s more we will be bringing in the New Year in style in this beautifully landscaped oasis with a special party and sacred cacao ceremony to set our intentions for 2018 and to really celebrate each other. The following day we will be offering Shamanic Sweat Lodge ceremonies to start a purification into the New Year. Jump into the culture and join us with the Lord of the Dance \u2013 Nataraj!\n\nSacred Cacao Ceremony\n\nChocolate as you\u2019ve never experienced it before \u2013 as a medicine in a group setting to create connection in community and become clearer about what really matters to your heart\n\nIn the ceremony there is a chance to re-connect to your heart\u2019s wisdom to set intentions of let go and also of bringing in new ways of being. In this warm space you are held and nurtured and will experience a heightened sense of connectedness to everyone else around you, others in your life who are not present and to the sacredness of all that surrounds you.\n\nWhat Happens in a Ceremony ?\n\nThe format is very loose allowing for us to tune into what is really alive and respond to that, rather than imposing structures from the mind. Very often it includes:\n\nMeditation\nIntention Setting\nDancing\nSoft Intimacy Exercises (respecting one\u2019s own boundaries of course!)\nTantra\nResting as a Group\nOur Drink\n\nThe drink used in our ceremony is made from 100% raw ceremonial grade cacao. It contains a  blend of spices and super foods and  is suitable for vegans.\n\nThe ceremony itself lasts for around 3 and a half hours but the effects stay around in a more subtle way for a few hours after this and you can tune into the wisdom by reconnecting to a quiet space. Some lethargy and emotional movement may occur later after a ceremony as there is an integration and rest period \u2013 this is a good time to allow all old emotions to just pass through like a breeze as deep patterns are released. Nurture and be easy on yourself.\n\nStudent Performances\n\nDuring the festival you will have a chance to take part in classes in various styles and learn a choreography piece from some world class teachers. These will be presented on the final evening as a culmination of the whole festival.\n\nYou can choose to take part in the classes listed in the menu above and then go on to be part of the performance \u2013 you can also just take these classes for fun.\n\nIn addition there is an open space for any hidden talents you have always wanted to be witnessed!\n\nEvening Entertainment\n\nLive music and Dj\u2019s will round off the evenings entertainment as we enjoy one last time to party and dance together \u2013 be warned this party can really take off and go late into the night so choose when you have enough energy in your feet to still take you to bed!\n\nPerformances\n\nAn evening program to relax and enjoy.\n\nThese are evening shows presented by our talented team of dance professionals that allow you to delight in the varied colours and styles of our team. They will include:\n\nBelly Dancing\n\nBelly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips. Unlike many Western dance forms, the focus of the dance is on relaxed, natural isolations of the torso muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear superficially similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are often driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis, which is usually more subtle and contained.\n\nCorrect posture and muscle control is as important in belly dance as it is in other fields of dance, and enables a dancer to move the hips freely whilst avoiding lower back injuries. The basic posture used varies slightly between styles (in particular, the knees may be more or less bent, weight may be held slightly further back or forward, and \u2018resting\u2019 arm position may vary), but a kinesiologically correct posture should always be used. Some belly dancers also study Pilates or Alexander technique in order to achieve a healthy and efficient posture.\n\nContemporary Dance\n\nContemporary dance is a popular form of dance which developed during the middle portion of the twentieth century and has since grown to become one of the dominating performance genres for formally trained dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe. Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical,modern, and jazz styles, it has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance,[1] but due to its popularity amongst trained dancers and some overlap in movement type, it is often perceived as being closely related to modern dance, ballet and other classical concert dance styles.\n\nIn terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to utilize both the strong and controlled legwork of ballet and modern dance\u2019s stress on the torso, and also employs contact-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristic of modern dance.[2] Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. It sometimes also incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance Butoh.\n\nBollywood Style\n\nThe term \u2018Bollywood\u2019 comes from the combination of the names of Bombay (now known as Mumbai) and Hollywood. The Bollywood film industry, based in Mumbai, is the largest film industry in the world in terms of ticket sales and the amount of films made per year.\n\nBollywood films are mostly musicals with very few movies made without at least one song and dance sequence. The films feature love interests, comedy and action thrills. The plots are often melodramatic and often feature star-crossed lovers, corrupt politicians, twins separated at birth, conniving villains, angry parents, courtesans with hearts of gold, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences.\n\nBhangra\n\nBhangra refers to several types of dance originating from the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.[1] The earliest developed of these was a folk dance conducted by Punjabis in the central northern areas of the region to celebrate the harvest, and whose general practice had ended by the Partition, 1947.\n\nIn the 1950s, a new folk dance, representative of the state of Punjab and composed of glimpses of men\u2019s Punjabi dance styles, was created and eventually received the title of bhangra. In 1954. first time bhangra was performed on stage. First developed in India and attaining a rather standardized form by the 1980s, the folkloric bhangra was exported to other countries by Punjabi emigrants.

Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects, the subject is strictly abstract. Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. The aesthetics of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it beautiful to the viewer.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Structural Biology using Single Particle Cryo Electron Microscopy (SP CryoEM) has become a major tool for studying macromolecular assemblies. Visualising unprecedented details of cellular components, and solving in-situ protein structures are now possible with advancement in CryoEM methods. Developments in Field Emission Gun (FEG) Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and other TEM hardware, CryoEM specimen preparation methods, automated data acquisition systems, Direct Electron Detectors and improved image processing software have led to regular &lt; 4 to 3 \u00c5 resolution structures of asymmetric proteins/protein-DNA/RNA complexes larger than 80 kDa in size being routinely solved. These cutting edge CryoEM methods for structural biology are relatively new in India, with a very few groups currently working in this field. However, there is intense interest in the Indian scientific community, particularly among structural biologists, about applications of this technique, which makes this course timely. This EMBO course will deal with Single particle Cryo Electron Microscopy of biological macromolecular assemblies and Cryo Electron Tomography of Cellular structures.\n\nAfter the immense success of the first CEM3DIP CryoEM course at IISER Thiruvananthapuram in 2016, this course will be taught for the second time in India at IIT Delhi and it will be the First CryoEM EMBO Practical course. This EMBO Practical Course will be of interest to molecular biologists, cell biologists, microbiologists, structural biologists (crystallographers), theoretical/computational biologists and biologists in many other areas. It is mainly aimed at advanced PhD students or postdoctoral researchers and faculties.\n\nThe principal themes and objectives of this EMBO Practical Course are:\n\n1) To promote the newly developing field of macromolecular structure determination by CryoEM and Cellular Tomography in India and other EMBC member states.\n\n2) To teach scientists (biologists, structural biologists etc.) wishing to determine macromolecular or cellular structure by cryo Electron Microscopy the basic principles and practical aspects of TEM in structural biology/structural cell biology.\n\n3) To provide hands on practice on specimen preparation, Fourier transform in image analysis, image processing for three-dimensional reconstruction. 3D Image Processing of Macromolecular Assemblies and cellular Tomography.\n\n4) The main objective of this EMBO Practical Course is to enable participants (at student, postdoc and laboratory PI level) to implement novel techniques learnt in this course, in their home laboratories and create an avalanche effect.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "EMBO Practical Course on Cem3dip 2018", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/embo-practical-course-on-cem3dip-2018/116712555656839", "address": "New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/cfc91d224d222a8e658b15c4f9ffcd01"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/embo-excellence-in-life-sciences/2312579", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/226032940763066/picture?type=large", "events_count": "31", "name": "EMBO - excellence in life sciences", "followers_count": "23"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2018-03-18 13:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.6139", "longitude": "77.2089"}},

Captivating the listener with his trademark melodramatic themes, toying with their senses almost effortlessly, his music bridges the aural with the emotional into a transcendental experience.\n\nA true perfectionist at heart, a trait he proudly carries on his sleeve. Every avenue he takes is paved with utmost attention to detail, which has not gone unnoticed by peers and fans alike. This recognition couldn't come higher than being named his favorite producer by the world's #1 DJ in DJ Mag. This search of musical perfection came to one eventual conclusion, the extension of his Arnej brand. Arnej Music the record label.\n\nWhether performing in front of crowds of 200 or 20,000, In a remarkably short period of time Arnej managed to set a name for himself amongst the DJ elite. The summation of his rise came also as one of his most humbling moments, when he was nominated as the best breakthrough DJ at the 26th annual IDMAs during the Winter Music Conference. Backed up by the fact that he's the 2nd highest DJ Mag ranked Trance DJ on the Western Hemisphere, is a testament of his work ethic and devotion to his craft. \n\n\nNDS &amp; Blue\n\nOne of the most talented dance music producers in India at the moment, with releases on top international labels and a lot more in process. Their tracks have been supported by Armin Van Buuren on ASOT, Above &amp; Beyond on Anjunabeats WorldWide and Group Therapy Radio, Paul Van Dyk on Vonyc Sessions and Markus Schulz on Global DJ Broadcast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of electronic music since the beginning\u201d says Siddharth of NDS and Blue fame. It was a long way when we started off but always had a clear goal and picture in our mind of where we want to reach with the potential and calibre we have. We are very happy and confident to be where we are as a Duo. We have achieved far more than what we had expected through the love and support of our fans! So whenever we enter the studio we just have one adage in mind that is to give something unique and special to the people who have an ear for electronic music.\n\nIt was when they were pursuing their higher studies in Delhi the passion for music struck them. They always had a quench for music. To start off the duo played at the local clubs just to try their luck with the city and to know how people are responding to their music as basic amateurs. After this the duo started with their monthly podcasts and their own night s called \u201cAftermidnight\u201d which again was a big hit among the audience and they claimed their way to success. They not only had their piece of fame locally, nationally but also internationally which was a stupendous deal for the duo. It was aired on some of the finest radios of the world, including \u2018Radio 1190 Colarado\u2019.\n\nThis also embarked the starting of the duo playing local acts at some of the finest clubs and residences. \nThey started recording their tunes with some eminent International artists. The duo also during this while performed some exceptional opening set for some mainstream artists like Bobina, Myon and Shane 54, Tritonal, Alex Morph, Cosmic Gate,Matt Darey,Nari &amp; Milani , Dash Berlin, Nervo, Porter Robinson, Hard Rock Sofa, Shogun, Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike, Hardwell etc.\n\nTheir tracks Alpha and Contra have created a strong brunt on the playlists. Alpha entered in the Beatport Top 100 Trance standing at the #65 position and also played in Anjunabeats Worldwide 332 and Contra having more than 15,000 downloads all over India.\nAlso performed at Sunburn Arena with one of the most reknowned artists in the world and Sunburn Campus in multiple city colleges in front of thousands of young kids filled with energy.\nThe influence of phenomenal Duo Nds&amp;Blue is very much evident and the tracks they have produced have remained memorable in the mind of the people. The duo says: \u201cHaving played live as much as we have these past three years, it\u2019s probably made us a bit more high-octane, a bit more adrenaline-filled, but because of that we probably also need to counter it more and make ourselves more better in the eyes and heart of the audience.\n\nMagnolia Sessions\n\nMagnolia Sessions: is a weekly EDM podcast with over 5,000 listeners globally and growing. Conceptualized in early 2013, Magnolia Sessions is Arjun Talwar and Karanvir Singh \u2013 one being a banker and the other being a music producer and the rest is well, a podcast. Besides their love for physical proximity, Talwar and Singh share a deep passion for electronic music and have managed to find expression with Magnolia Sessions. Arjun believes it\u2019s soulful, positive and that the feel of EDM is unparalleled, while Karanvir thinks it to be the easiest medium to transfer energy and emotions from one person to another\n\nNorth &amp; South: is Karanvir Singh\u2019s alias. Under this banner, he has produced original tracks like \u201cFreedom\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d and remixed many favorites like \u201cLongest Road\u201d and \u201cSpectrum\u201d. North &amp; South is primarily high energy beats and big room sounds \u2013 he takes over towards the last segment of the gig to ensure that the \u201cbounce factor\u201d is never missing\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Sunburn presents Arnej India Tour : Delhi | NDS & Blue + Magnolia Session || Pangaea || FlashWave Ent.||", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/sunburn-presents-arnej-india-tour-delhi-|-nds-and-blue-magnolia-session-||-pangaea-||-flashwave-ent|/155892491266056", "address": "New Delhi", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/471b635b809046e634d13dd932154d72"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/dhruv-bhasin/4434803", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/10202371496543712/picture?type=large", "events_count": "0", "name": "Dhruv Bhasin", "followers_count": "22"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2020-08-19 00:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "", "longitude": ""}},

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Let us make our Country Clean.\n\nThe father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi had said that, \u201cSanitation is more important than Independence\u201d during his time before the independence of India. He was well aware of the bad and unclean situation of the India. He had emphasized the people of India a lot about the cleanliness and sanitation as well as its implementation in the daily lives. However, it was not so effective and failed because of the incomplete participation of people. After many years of independence of India, a most effective campaign of cleanliness is launched to call people for their active participation and complete the mission of cleanliness.\n\nThe President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has said in June 2014 while addressing the Parliament that, \u201cFor ensuring hygiene, waste management and sanitation across the nation a Swachh Bharat Mission will be launched. This will be our tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019\u201d. In order to fulfill the vision of Mahatma Gandhi and make India an ideal country all over the world, the Prime Minister of India has initiated a campaign called Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan on the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi (2nd of October 2014). This campaign has the target of completion of mission till 2019 means 150th birthday anniversary of the Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThrough this campaign the government of India would solve the sanitation problems by enhancing the waste management techniques. Clean India movement is completely associated with the economic strength of the country. The birth date of the Mahatma Gandhi is targeted in both, the launch and completion of the mission. The basic goals behind launching the Swachh Bharat Mission are to make the country full of sanitation facilities as well as eliminate all the unhealthy practices of people in daily routines. The first cleanliness drive in India was started on 25th of September in 2014 and first initiated by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi by cleaning the road.\n\nThe completion of this mission would indirectly draw the attention of business investors in India, enhance the GDP growth, draw tourists attention from all over the world, bring variety of sources of employment, reduce health costs, reduce death rate, and reduce lethal disease rate and many more. Clean India would bring more tourists and enhance its economical condition. The Prime Minister of India has requested to every Indian to devote their 100 hours per year for the cleanliness in India which is very sufficient to make this country a clean country by 2019. \n                         \n                              Need of Clean India Club\n\u2022\tIt is to implement the proper waste management through the scientific processes, hygienic disposal, reuse, and recycling of the municipal solid wastes.\n\u2022\tIt is to bring behavioral changes among Indian people regarding maintenance of personal hygiene and practice of healthy sanitation methods.\n\u2022\tIt is to create global awareness among common public living in rural areas and link it to the public health.\n\u2022\tIt is to support working bodies to design, execute and operate the waste disposal systems locally.\n\u2022\tIt is to bring private-sector participation to develop sanitary facilities all through the India.\n\u2022\tIt is to make India a clean and green India.\n\u2022\tIt is necessary to improve the quality of life of people in rural areas.\n\u2022\tIt is to bring sustainable sanitation practices by motivating communities and Panchayati Raj Institutions through the awareness programmes like health education.\n\u2022\tIt is to bring the dream of Bapu to really come true.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Clean India Club", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/clean-india-club/500042600164593", "address": "New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/bannerspace/b547c6f761b1cf4705fe7fdda868cde8"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/rashmi-chaturvedi/3754897", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/727490664015856/picture?type=large", "events_count": "4", "name": "Rashmi Chaturvedi", "followers_count": "66"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2019-03-31 22:00:00", "end": "2019-04-01 01:00:00"}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.6139", "longitude": "77.2089"}},

The active participation of ICGEB Member States nationals in the ICGEB Meetings and Courses is therefore highly encouraged. For more information on the terms of participation and funding opportunities for this event please access the meeting website or contact the local organiser directly.\n\nThe course will provide theoretical and practical training on advance analytical instrumentation i.e., mass spectrometry based omics techniques and genome scale modeling to identify metabolic pathways and to engineer algal cell factories for biofuel production. The course defines a basic workflow to design an experiment i.e., nutrient deprivation triggers lipid production followed by over view of analytical procedures such as GC-MS, LC-MS and to evaluate the metabolic pathways involved in production of biofuel precursors. Understanding metabolic networks will provide an efficient framework to describe cellular metabolism in algae and can be important tool in metabolic engineering, and strain optimization. Genome-scale models integrated with omics data, such as transcriptional profiling, allows development of a meaningful systemic representation of metabolism that could improve the production of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and other biochemicals.\n\nTopics\nOmics-based approach to evaluate algal cell factories, Integration of multi-omics data and reconstruction of metabolic regulatory pathways, Data analysis and annotation of algal omics research, Genome scale modeling of algal cell factories.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Course \"New frontiers in algal omics\"", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/course-new-frontiers-in-algal-omics/114076722622523", "address": "ICGEB, ICGEB, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c171.0.200.200/p200x200/22050207_1459264067503695_8944985485975887800_n.jpg?oh=f1aedec51b009944d0fa41c884e966e7&oe=5AA567ED"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/international-centre-for-genetic-engineering-and-biotechnology-trieste/1109725", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/113149942115121/picture?type=large", "events_count": "33", "name": "International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Trieste", "followers_count": "33"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2018-11-19 09:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.5295745975", "longitude": "77.16796529"}},

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     The AAS-in-Asia conferences have been conceptualised with an aim to give our members and others interested in Asian Studies, who are unable to attend the Annual Conferences held in North America, an opportunity to participate in panel sessions and network with colleagues in a more intimate setting. Although smaller in magnitude, these conferences include the same exciting features as the Annual Conference including sessions, keynote speakers, book exhibits and receptions. Each year, AAS-in-Asia conferences are a joint production between the Association for Asian Studies and a local host university and committee.\n\nOn behalf of the Association for Asian Studies (AAS) and Ashoka University, India, we are pleased to invite you to submit proposals for organized panels and roundtables to be presented at the fifth AAS-in-Asia Conference being, held between 5th and 8th of July 2018 at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi, India.\n\nThe Program Committee for the AAS-in-Asia conference seeks proposals pertaining to all regions of Asia, on subjects covering a wide range of scholarly disciplines and professional fields under the theme - Asia in Motion: Geographies and Genealogies. Derived from the Greco-Roman conception of the world, the concept of Asia has a perverse genealogy as Europe\u2019s other. Asians, thus, have experienced 'Asia' in ephemeral, uneven, and fleeting modes. At its heart lie the limits of inherited geographical categories. Nevertheless, the concept of Asia retains notable power in the political imagination. It serves as a critique of geography as a historical category and of the Asian nation-states that are today asserting themselves politically, economically, and geographically by invoking older and mythic forms of Asian culture and genealogies. We invite proposals that interrogate received ideas of Asia and conceive of new spatial and temporal imaginings, and that explore, understand, and reassert those Asia's that exist beyond conventional political geographies.\n\nDelhi, the venue of the AAS-in-Asia, is an opportune place to pose these questions. As being on the margins of Asia, the subcontinent has always confounded the geographic and genealogical imagination of Asia. Panels are welcomed from scholars in disciplines across the field of Asian studies, wherever they may be based academically, and are especially encouraged from scholars representing academic communities that are relatively underrepresented in international meetings. One of the goals of this AAS-in-Asia conference is to foster lines of dialogue and scholarly communication that cross the ordinary (often nation-specific) boundaries of academic networks. \n\nPlease note: The program committee will strongly favor and give preference to proposals that include participants from two or more countries, whether the panel focuses on a single nation or culture or focuses on some comparative dimension. The program discourages panel proposals from a group of scholars coming from the same institution. Generally speaking, panels with diverse (gender, academic rank, national origin, disciplinary approach) participation will be favored over narrowly constructed panels. Panels that address topics of broad relevance will also be preferred.\n\nWe are happy to announce the following sessions that will be held during the conference:\n1) Keynote speaker: James C.

This Craft has championed its innovative techniques to reversible garments as it is the only embroidery form in the world that looks mirrored from both side and exactly same. Today it is practised by handful in the valleys of Chamba, a region in Himachal Pradesh. This craft originated, developed and flourished in the erstwhile state of Chamba in the 17 \u2013 18 century AD. A translation of Pahari miniature paintings were embedded in fabrics through Kashidakari (embroidery), a celebrated feminine craft tradition of Himachal Pradesh, India. Learn from the legend who has given her 45-years in up-liftment of this Craft...and perhaps the only one in the world to receive the highest honour in form of Presidential Medal in this Craft.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     MASTER ARTIST: Errol Pires Nelson\n\nDESCRIPTION\nPly-split braiding is a technique where one twisted cord (\u201csplitter\u201d) passes through another twisted cord or cords splitting the plies of the latter cords (\u201csplittee\u201d cords). This is unlike weaving or many forms of braiding where cloth is formed by threads interlacing in an over-under sequence. Pattern is formed by cord color, and splitting order.In 1974 and 1975, two graduate students from UCLA conducted field research in Rajasthan and Gujarat in north-western India. They were introduced to Ishwar Singh, a master girth maker, who spent several weeks with them demonstrating the construction of the girths. Their 1982 publication, \"The Ply-Split Camel Girths of West India\" [2] was the first to document the entire traditional process, including spinning, plying, cordmaking, and three structures of ply-splitting. These are SCOT, mentioned above, as well as plain oblique twining (POT) and two-layered oblique interlacing (TLOI).

Kantha embroidery is derived from 'Katha'-which represents the most iconic stories of West Bengal, this rare craft also has sanskrit connotation that means \u2018rags\u2019, which reflects the fact that Kantha embroidery is made up of discarded garments or textiles or perhaps the best example of oldest sustainable &amp; recyled craft of the world! It is when mothers had to prepare little bedding for their newly born, they could only think of fabric that is worn, used and not starched. This way they introduced a soft fabric to newly born taking care of fresh skin and warmth of love. These fabrics needed to be prepared and stitched together in a way that it brings out a design. This embroidery or stitching together of fabrics was Kantha- also known as Katha(story)\nWHO CAN JOIN: Textile Enthusiasts\nFEE: 5000/- including (material and lunch)\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Kantha-pride of bengal", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/kantha-pride-of-bengal/123206278254415", "address": "Craft Village, 19B, Shivji Marg, Westend Green Farms, Rangpuri, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/bannerspace/ee3345b0c582ebb6cff074d711f5833c"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/craft-village/5261171", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/481504451962990/picture?type=large", "events_count": "12", "name": "Craft Village", "followers_count": "61"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2018-04-07 10:00:00", "end": "2018-04-08 17:00:00"}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.53134", "longitude": "77.12329"}},

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     The workshop is oriented towards exploring the possibilities of the way we think about materials and design. Here we will design a form or material that is reactive as well as responsive in nature.\n\nIt will explore the notions of adaptability and interactivity in architecture &amp; design and aims to expand beyond the use of the computer and digital fabrication into robotics, electronics and physical computing platforms. Sensing and Interactive technologies in architecture and design aims to highlight process of design and through that what can be achieved with the help of integration of technologies in it. The workshop goes into establishing physical and digital connections leveraging operational flexibility and fluidity using Grasshopper.\n\nThe workshop will strive to highlight intelligence in systems and pose the problem of multiple contradicting parameters in digital design. The workshop will focus in creating physical interactive prototypes responding to certain parameters or information. Grasshopper and plugin Firefly paired with Arduino Board's computing platform will be introduced to participants as possible tools for experimentation.\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURE \nParticipant will get to experiment upon sensors and actuators with the help of Arduino board and visual programming in Grasshopper. A 3D form created using Rhinoceros and Grasshopper will be used to emulate the data taken from sensors. Each topic will be presented with both theoretical introduction and practical application. In the afternoon of the second day, participants will split into groups to develop their own projects, with direct supervision by the tutors, and towards their last day evening presentation.\nThe workshop technical tutorials will include: \n-\tGrasshopper Visual Interface\n-\tUse of sensors in making interactive structures\n-\tUse of actuators\n-\tReading and translation of digital signals using Arduino\n-\tProgramming Arduino boards through visual programming\n-\tUse of emulator to emulate Arduino boards.\n-\tUnderstanding Microprocessor and Microcontroller\n-\tOpen sound control\n-\tLists &amp; Data Management, Manipulation, Visualization on Arduino\n-\tCreating interactive fa\u00e7ade using visual programming in grasshopper\n\n\n\nTOOLS\nAll the participants should have following tools installed on their workstations: \n-\tRhinoceros SR12 or Higher (30 day Trial version can be downloaded from  https://www.rhino3d.com/download)\n-\tGrasshopper for Rhino\n-\tFirefly for Grasshopper \n-\tArduino IDE\n-\tLunchbox  for Grasshopper\n-\tAutoCAD \n-\tAdobe Suite\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS \n-\tParticipants should bring their own computer with above mentioned software installed. More details will be sent to the registered participants.\n-\tIntermediate knowledge of 3D modelling acquired on Rhino. Basic knowledge of Grasshopper would be a plus\n-\tIn order to experiment on your own Arduino kit an extra amount of Rs. 2700 for Arduino kit has to be paid.

We haven't been since the winter of '15, so after a break of two years, we wanted to put this back on the calendar, and organise a super trip up from Delhi.\n\nThis is the opposite of staying at fancy places like Khyber - our goal is to go for as long as possible (a couple of us are planning to spend a full six weeks up), and we want to keep it cheap and fun. So expect to share a room, make friends, and be a part of our Delhi group.\n\nWe will be staying near the gondola, which is where all of the fun places to hang out are concentrated, there used to be a lively after-ski scene at Gulmarg! It's great fun to be out all day, work super hard, and then get to chill by a fire with a hot toddy (or a beer) and meet people.\n\nWe expect acco to run about Rs 2,300 per person per night for sharing, and Rs 4,600 for a room to yourself; this includes breakfast and dinner. Gear and guides will run about Rs 1,500 per day. So plan your trip accordingly! Flights are super cheap, &lt; 5k roundtrip from Delhi, plus an additional Rs 2,500 or so for taxi rides from SXR to Gulmarg.\n\nIf you're interested, accept this invite, we'll keep posting updates here, and email us at team | delhirock ! com with questions and your dates!\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Gulmarg Winter '18", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/gulmarg-winter-18/1900267450189875", "address": "Delhi Rock, Premises Nanaksar Gurudwara, opp M-39, GK2, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/5f7a66ad8f79f6db9f8a344000d6a18d"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/delhi-rock/520453", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/159158704112897/picture?type=large", "events_count": "5", "name": "Delhi Rock", "followers_count": "52"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2018-02-03 07:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.535134028369", "longitude": "77.245581150055"}},

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Are you interested in gaining Parametric competency to push your design skills to the next level?Are you ready to learn a very exciting and powerful tool that will take your ideas and concepts to a whole new realm?\n\nThe two-day introductory workshop to parametric design with interactive digital simulation in Design, integrated within the algorithmic modelling. It will allow to investigate new formal solutions optimized for the architecture and design. It will also include a lecture and presentations on the subject of complexity in natural systems and how to incorporate it as a design tool.\n\nThe recent development of sophisticated computational design tools has instigated new ways of integrating computation in the design process; both within architecture and engineering disciplines. The new set of digital tools has infiltrated a bottom up system to open the design space towards a high level of complexity. The integration of these tools allowed the architect to generate and control complex information derived from a manifold of sources. Consequently, a more complex architectural order emerged as a reflection of sophisticated adaptive structures. \n\nThe workshop will explore algorithmic strategies and the main techniques of form finding using the basic and intermediate level tools in Rhinoceros. The techniques will be applied at different scales, from architecture (surface modelling) to product level design. The model will further explore the fabrication methodologies in architecture and design.\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURE \nProgram has been structured to teach participants the use of Rhino and associated plugins that help in achieving parametric fabrications, with a real design exercise. Participants will learn how to build and manage parametric data structures (from basic simple lists to complex data Structures) and to develop data driven geometry and envelops. This will help them in understanding and taking the data visualization to next level.\nThe workshop technical tutorials will include: \n-\tSoftware interface\n-\tComponents\n-\tNURBS and polygon meshes, Polygonal modelling in Rhinoceros\n-\tLists &amp; Data Management, Manipulation, Visualization\n-\tGeometry generation from data stream\n-\tBasic exercises (Attractor field, Surface subdivision, Morphing\n-\tApplication of the learned techniques in a parametric design exercise.\n-\tFabrication tools and plugins to realize your parametric designs.\n\n\n\nTOOLS\nAll the participants should have following tools installed on their workstations: \n-\tRhinoceros SR12 or Higher (30 day Trial version can be downloaded from  https://www.rhino3d.com/download)\n-\tPanellingTools for Rhino ( https://wiki.mcneel.com/labs/panelingtools)\n-\tT Splines for Rhino ( http://www.tsplines.com/latestversion)\n-\tAutoCAD \n-\tAdobe Suite\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS \n-\tThere are no prerequisites, anyone from the design background or an enthusiast in the field of design are invited for this workshop.\n-\tParticipants should bring their own computer with above mentioned software installed.

(Poprzednio podczas pobytu w Indiach robi\u0142am to dla dw\u00f3ch najbli\u017cszych mi os\u00f3b i okaza\u0142o si\u0119 to bardzo mocne i skutkuj\u0105ce du\u017cymi zmianami w ich \u017cyciu). \nPo nied\u0142ugim czasie na mojej drodze stan\u0119\u0142a Ula, kt\u00f3ra r\u00f3wnie\u017c wie jak wielk\u0105 waro\u015b\u0107 ma praca z biopolem cz\u0142owieka jak i obci\u0105\u017ceniami karmicznymi w miejscach mocy. Takie miejsca gdzie energia jaka bije z ziemii mocniej nazywane s\u0105 czakramami (w Polsce jednym z s\u0142ynniejszych jest Wawel). Ludzie od zawsze w takich miejscach stawiali \u015bwi\u0105tynie z uwagi na okoliczno\u015b\u0107, \u017ce wszelkie dzia\u0142ania, wypowiadane s\u0142owa jak i modlitwy zyskuj\u0105 wi\u0119ksz\u0105 moc.

Mistrz bardzo by\u0142 zainteresowany poznaniem mnie jak i Urszuli - My nie mniej jeste\u015bmy nim zainteresowane ;) . Tak zrodzi\u0142 si\u0119 pomys\u0142 na jednodniowe spotkanie z Nim w New Delhi. Podczas tego spotkania pos\u0142uchamy jego wyk\u0142adu, mo\u017cna b\u0119dzie  zada\u0107 mu ka\u017cde pytanie.

Gurdyal nie bierze za to op\u0142at - mo\u017cna da\u0107 pieni\u0105dze wed\u0142ug swojego uznania. \nPo spotkaniu b\u0119dziemy mieli czas wolny na zakupy na pobliskim targu - tu polecam pomoc Beaty.

We urge to give the maximum amount that would allow you to attend without challenging your pockets or your hearts. \nAs a guideline, if participants were to contribute Rs. 3800 each, it would cover costs, and allow us to give the trainer an honorarium. And because we know that some people may not be able to give this amount, we are trusting that some people would have the willingness and capacity to give a lot more than Rs. 3800.\n\nABOUT THE EVENT: \n(In Miki's words)\nGandhi spoke about applying nonviolence in thought, word, and action. I have found that applying nonviolence becomes progressively more difficult the closer it is to thought. Many more people can refrain from physically violent acts than from using the language of judgments, threats, or demands. Similarly, many more people can train their language than can train their mind and heart to hold the commitment to live through the powerful combination of compassion, fierceness, and courage, with an uncompromising willingness to stand for truth. \n\nNonviolent Communication (NVC), a process created by Marshall Rosenberg in the 1960s, is designed to do just that: to help us integrate as far as possible our commitment to nonviolence all the way into the deepest structures of our thoughts; to speak in ways that carry this commitment forward into all of our relationships; and to apply this consciousness in all our actions, including our participation in the collective enterprise called social structures.\n\nAs a contribution to this commitment, this event focuses on what nonviolence means in everyday life. As much as we want to take on the global challenges of our times and move toward transformation, unless we learn, in parallel and at the same time, how to live differently within ourselves and with each other, we run the risk of recreating the very structures we want to transform. \n\nEmbracing nonviolence as a deep practice is something many of us find daunting, precisely because we have all internalized the structures of thought, word, and action that have brought us to where we are. To move from where we are to what we want to embrace, we will need to overcome the fear and shame that get in our way of embracing love and truth as core principles of being; to welcome conflict and challenge as a path towards greater wholeness; to examine our assumptions about ourselves and others; and to move closer to the dream of Rumi\u2019s field, where we can live beyond thoughts of right-doing and wrong-doing.\n\nWhen I was experimenting with how to support myself and others in doing this, I stumbled upon the possibility of creating a list of seventeen core commitments that can support our path by providing antidotes to the obstacles that keep us separate, desperate, and powerless. The commitments serve as a compass, a reminder, a scaffolding that can hold us in living by choice. These help us navigate the challenging struggles of everyday living so we can come to more and more integrity in how we live our lives, moving closer and closer to being aligned with our core values of nonviolence, and at the same time finding more and more gentleness toward ourselves when we don\u2019t. \n\nThe design of our time together is likely to include some combination of the following:\n\n\u2022\tFocusing deeply on some of the commitments (based on what the group brings)\n\u2022\tExperiential activities about how to lean on the commitments for greater choice\n\u2022\tDaily practices for ongoing integration of this framework\n\u2022\tExplorations of how to create enough support for the emerging shifts\n\u2022\tLooking at an 18th commitment that\u2019s being considered in addition \n\nREGISTRATION\nTo register, please click on or copy paste the link:  https://goo.gl/MtZdt6\n\nCONTACT\n For any questions and concerns, please email us (newdelhipracticegroup | gmail ! com) or call us (+91 9313064344 / 9560345731 / 9810344789) \nYou could also leave us a message on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/newdelhipracticegroup/\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Miki Kashtan in Delhi: Living by Choice", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/miki-kashtan-in-delhi-living-by-choice/1987422658155483", "address": "D 333 Defence Colony, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/bannerspace/61cebfae33449480508fcebb9df96d78"], "organizer": {}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2018-01-03 15:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "", "longitude": ""}},

The journey into Petra starts through the Siq, a very narrow gorge, about one kilometre in length, flanked on both sides by towering rock walls that reach a height of 70 metres. At the end of the Siq is the Treasury (the Khaznah) with its massive fa\u00e7ade carved into the solid rock face \u2013 this is the defining image of Jordan made famous by the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

He combined ancient knowledge about the curative and expressive power of the dance with new scientific insights.\n\nBiodanza is the invitation to dance life! In all moods and life situations. It does not teach step-by-step or dance techniques. It is not the aesthetics of movement, but the experience in the here and now. In dances and exercises to the universal language of music - alone, in the couple or in the group - the aspects of human coexistence are explored and integrated. The figure music-emotion-expression is closed again and immediately available for everyday life. Biodanza analyzes and focuses not on the deficit aspects, but turns to the liberation of what generally strengthens humans and makes life more valuable. It activates body-specific substances, which increase the well-being.\n\nBIO (S) Greek word stem \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2: Life\n\nDANZA (spanish) originates from the old dance: the realization of inspiration in movement with feeling expression.\n\nBiodanza therefore means living movement full of meaning. Through Biodanza, you will learn to give your movements back to content and meaning.\n\nTo describe biodanza is as hard as describing love or life. Only through experience can I grasp the entire meaning of Biodanza. Biodanza is oriented to abundance, not to lack. It opens the universe of your possibilities.\n\nprogram:\n\nday 1: Theoretical mode land 2 Biodanza sessions\n\nday2: Building a organic class and 2 Biodanza sessions\n\nday3: Alle about music to bring the theory in practice in your own classes.\n\nday 4: To bring the theory in practice in your own classes.\n\n\nFacilitator: Manju\n\nHer spiritual Journey started 1986 with a intense Sufi practice and Shamanic work with JABRANE Sebant. 1990 she meet her Indian Master H.W.L Ponnja (PAPAJI) in Lucknow which named her MANJU and spend through three Years much time with him in Lucknow. 1992 she started her Biodanza training directly with the founder of BIODANZA Rolando TORO ARANEDA in Italy. She was his close colaborator in Austria from 1992 until his dead in 2010.

This ensures that the school leaders are always updated with the latest tools that can be implemented back in their schools.\n\nThis platform has now grown to become an important and most attended platform by school leaders from India where they meet, learn and network with domain experts and fellow school leaders from India and abroad.\n\nThis conference is organized with the support of EduExcellence Educational Society.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Educarnival 2017 IIT Delhi- Biggest Gathering of school Leaders", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/educarnival-2017-iit-delhi-biggest-gathering-of-school-leaders/1141145026018034", "address": "IIT Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/bannerspace/988837db7d9ac13c80e50ac732ae3502"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/eduexcellence/3349739", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/167027529998303/picture?type=large", "events_count": "2", "name": "EduExcellence", "followers_count": "3"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-21 09:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.545188216208", "longitude": "77.193069476906"}},

While dates may be flexible, but this is gigantic news for the two (out of the three) most populous cities in the subcontinent.  \n\nThe two cities join a harrowed list of some of the most successful Ultra stops in the world. India is known for being a massive consumer of electronic dance music and culture so it is only right that the country gets not one, but two Ultra Music Festivals. This also means that Ultra is very serious about continuing to expand it's brand. Only a decade ago only one Ultra existed and now slowly over the course of many years there are 24 different Ultra Music Festivals all over the globe.\n\nUltra Music Festival India will no doubt be two entirely unique experiences that are an absolute must for any and all international dance music fan. We are not only excited to learn more about what the festival plans to do as they release details about the two new festivals, but are also incredibly excited to see the reaction of Indian fans. The local talent in India has been noted over the years as the country is a breeding ground for euphoric high energy trance.

Phad in local dialect means \u2018fold\u2019 and this is used as a canvas to depict various episodes from the life of local deities, mainly Pabuji and Devnarayan. Lord Devnarayan is believed to be the incarnation of Hindu god Vishnu and Pabuji, the incarnation of Laxman (brother of lord Rama).\n\nThis art form is more than seven hundred years old and this style of painting is mainly done by Joshi families of Bhilwara district in Rajasthan. Long time ago, Chochu Bhat, a profound devotee of Lord Devnarayan commissioned the \u2018Joshi family\u2019 to illustrate the entire life of the folk-deity on Phad. From then onwards, Joshi families have become the traditional torchbearers of this art form.\n\nConducted by: Nazariya\nDuration: 1.30 - 2.00 hours\nCost: Rs.1050 + Taxes\n\nAn initiative by Kunzum Travel Cafe, Shankar Lal Bhopa and Nazariya\n\nBOOK YOUR SLOTS!

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Embassy of Hungary, Hungarian Information and Cultural Centre and Gallery Sree Arts presents a thought provoking exhibition by an Indian contemporary artist P.S. Sujeet  titled \u201c100 Shades of Perspectives\u201d curated by Jitendra Padam Jain on Thursday, 15th December 2017 at 6 pm at the Art Gallery of Hungarian Centre. The exhibition will be on view for public till 19th December from 10 am to 4pm. \nAbout the exhibition:\nThe exhibition, in acrylic on canvas and mix media on paper, is a stark yet geometric portrayal of the spiritual and modern life. It is a unique and insightful scrutiny of the way our lives are headed. The canvases invite the connoisseur to delve deep into the gauge of black and white within themselves and the world around them and at the same time accept the hues of grey and the stark colour drawing myriad interpretations of life, man and his humanness. \nThe curator and the artist were working on this concept past three months. The canvases portray the artist Sujeet\u2019s conflict and cares and his creative urge to present his besieged soul onto paper.\nSujeet is a creative spirit spewing his creativity into paintings. A graduate from The Delhi College of Arts in Applied Art, Sujeet spent several eventful years in the Television and Broadcast Industry. His creative urge took him to founding and running Grasshopper Media, a leading design house, besides juggling as a part time lecturer teaching MFA students at his Alma Mater.\nBorn in Hojai, a small town in Assam, Sujeet spent his childhood and a large part of his youth going to the government school Janakpuri and growing up playing cars with spare tyres in the by lanes of humble Delhi, where life was not easy but not too dull either.\nSujeet has now taken refuge in geometric shapes hidden in everyday life. A large part of Sujeet\u2019s inspiration is drawn from his childhood impressions that left an indelible mark on his psyche.\nThe black and white paintings bring to life the ruthlessness of life whereas the contrasting colour and the indefinable shades of grey bring myriad interpretations to the surprises that come with everyday. The paintings depict the struggle, the joys and the reality of everyday modern life. In pen and ink, these canvases are an ode to man and his humanness.\n\nHe was born in 1972 and is settled in New Delhi aspiring to put more and more of his perspectives onto canvas.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "100 Shades of Perspective", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/100-shades-of-perspective/305550859963176", "address": "Hungarian Information and Cultural Centre, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/316af7df774f65f8941791056ef773a6-rimg-w200-h200-gmir"], "organizer": {}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-15 18:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.601542793865", "longitude": "77.217134720741"}},

Through all these years, Ananda continued to learn and develop on various spiritual and healing modalities including Reiki, Osho meditation techniques and Sufi practices like Du\u2019a, Whirling and Gibberish.\n\nHaving keen interest in music, dance, expressive art and poetry she wishes to encourage their use as therapeutic techniques. She sees beauty in the sacred as well as mundane and derives her bliss from spreading joy! Zorba the Buddha brought about a turning point in Ananda\u2019s spiritual quest, such that she has now re-located back to India with the vision to amalgamate the Western education with Eastern spiritual practices.\n\nSwami Kulbhushan\n\nOver 45 years ago, Swami Anand Kulbhushan started on his spiritual safari with whirling. Since then, he has been into whirling as he learnt about the great Sufi masters from Osho. In his travels to over 50 countries, he visited Iran, Egypt, Turkey and the Sudan where he witnessed Sufism in action. He has conducted numerous Sufi meditation camps with enthusiastic response.\n\nTarisha\n\nTarisha is both a singer and songwriter of exceptional talent. She is everyone\u2019s soul sister, calling us to come out of our shells and enter into a divine rapture of sound and silence. Her exquisite voice carries us to the heights of the soul and back again to our shamanic earth. Her range of expression is simply awesome. Tarisha will be composing a special Festival Song, and slowly, day by day this song will evolve into a several part harmony, including movements, connections and dance, creating a magic spell of enchantment.\n\nTarisha is also a Singing Medicine Woman who works magic through her voice. Her sessions are uniquely personal, deeply relaxing and full of spirit. You are bathed in beauty and sound.\n\nHealers and Therapists :\n\nSamya\n\nSamya is yoga practitioner and certified yoga therapist, a reflexologist and naturopath. She practices Osho meditations, tibetan pulsing and tantra for couples. Samya has traveled across the world to learn different techniques of massage. Her expertise lies in body work, which is a deep tissue massage with body aligning stretches. The process includes other forms of energy work as per the need of the moment and person. Though the work is quite deep at the physical level, it also intensely relaxing on a mental level and balancing at an energetic level. Samya absolutely in love with her body yearns to share ways how to befriend our bodies.\n\nFESTIVAL DETAILS: (5 NIGHTS 6 DAYS)\n\nDate &amp; Time :  \n\nCheck in : 15th Dec 2017 (12.00 PM)\n\nCheck out :  20th Dec 2017 (10.00 AM)\n\n\nContact 1 : Tamanna\nPhone : +91 9654322882 \nEmail : joy | zorbathebuddha ! org\n\nContact 2 : Shilpi\nPhone : +91 9311902245\nEmail : nirvana | zorbathebuddha ! org\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Osho International Festival Dec 2017", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/osho-international-festival-dec-2017/251555311988587", "address": "Zorba the Buddha, 7, Tropical Drive road, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Rd, Ghitorni, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/db170b339b7f6f08ac64c7de8d477fd7"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/zorba-the-buddha/399540", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/103251593067938/picture?type=large", "events_count": "23", "name": "Zorba The Buddha", "followers_count": "1310"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-15 12:00:00", "end": "2017-12-20 10:00:00"}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.497547686178", "longitude": "77.147927284241"}},

But the concept has evolved over time and has become a premier platform for hosting and promoting innovations in the industry and creating better business networking opportunities among decision makers of procurement companies and suppliers.\n\nExpanding Footprints : The exhibition was conceptualized and organized in Mumbai for the very first time and now it has expanded its presence across major cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. An indisputable leader in the Indian trade fair domain, ACETECH is also deemed the largest exhibition in Asia and the third largest in the world. \n\nExclusive Conferences and Allied Events: The show format enables exhibitors from around the world to showcase their potential by providing detailed demonstrations of latest products and services within industry-segmented pavilions. The Allied Events and Conferences formulated by ACETECH aims to bring the industry leaders and government bodies together to network, exchange ideas and invest in a progressive nation-building activity. Design Wall brings latest products and innovations to the fore for review by industry experts whereas CONNECT offers the opportunity for procurement teams of companies to directly meet and source from material suppliers and technology providers on project requirement basis. The Global Green Summit was instituted to focus on green initiatives while Indian Paints &amp; Coating Forum (IPCF) provides a platform to all the stakeholders in the Indian Paint and Coating industry to discuss the trends and challenges faced. ACETECH Alpha Awards acknowledges the alpha leaders and innovators who have changed the face of the industry through their intuitive insights, leadership skills and perceptive designs whereas Walk the Talk with your Mentor gives an opportunity to the young minds of architecture and design to interact and learn from the stalwarts of the profession.\n\nGovernment Support: Over the years, top government authorities have extended their support to the exhibition. Last year, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Honourable Union Minister of Road Transport, Highways and Shipping inaugurated the Delhi 2015 edition while Shri. Devendra Fadnavis, Chief Minister of Maharashtra inaugurated the Mumbai 2014 edition and Shri. Venkaiah Naidu, Union Minister of Urban Development inaugurated the Delhi 2014 edition and Shri.

Though sanitation was a part of human life since the ancient times, it gained importance with the development of human civilization. As civilization started to expand with its diversity, sanitation became one of the necessities of human society. The culture of sanitation refers to the ways in which different cultural groups developed attitudes, values and habits regarding sanitation. Sanitation has a long history at various levels of human civilisation.\n\nObjectives of the Seminar:\nThe objective of this seminar is to hold a comprehensive dialogue to conceptualise the complex cultural, social and sanitation issues, and to develop an incisive perspective on the growth of a new culture of sanitation. The Seminar will try to set a roadmap for future strategy and interventions, and will add to the corpus of knowledge and research on the Culture of Sanitation.\n\nIndia today under the dynamic leadership of Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has put sanitation in the centre of civilizational debate, underlining its fundamental importance and how important it is from development perspective. We will intensively debate it with a perspective to achieve the goal of a Clean India, which is a prerequisite for a developed India.\n\nFor more information about the seminar kindly visit :  http://seminar.sulabhinternational.org/\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "National Seminar on Renaissance of the Culture of Sanitation", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/national-seminar-on-renaissance-of-the-culture-of-sanitation/336526800039360", "address": "Mavalankar Hall, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/f10541f98f17df9c86e172fa1648a218"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/sulabh-international-social-service-organisation/7452295", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/388894784505975/picture?type=large", "events_count": "2", "name": "Sulabh International Social Service Organisation", "followers_count": "0"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-12 10:30:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.622475", "longitude": "77.22119"}},

Here, we shall also display the long-standing camaraderie with allies, and also touch on important chapters like coming out, emotional well-being, and most importantly, sensitizing and reaching out to

Simple and sparsely embroidered odini (head scarfs), dupatta and shawls, made for everyday use, are called Phulkaris, whereas garments that cover the entire body, made for special and ceremonial occasions like weddings and birth of a son, fully covered fabric is called Baghs (\"garden\") and scattered work on the fabric is called \"adha bagh\" (half garden). This whole work is done with white or yellow silk floss on cotton khaddarh and starts from the center on the fabric called \"chashm-e-bulbul\" and spreads to the whole fabric. \nSimran's masterpieces in Phulkari have draped the likes of Gursharan Kaur, the better half of the Indian Prime Minister, and Camilla Parker Bowles, wife of London\u2019s Prince Charles. \nBut, Harika refuses to open a commercial outlet and prefers instead an elite clientele which values her home-embroidered Phulkaris for their original craftsmanship. Her reputation makes the Punjab government approach her whenever a visiting dignitary is to be felicitated with a memento.\n\nWHO CAN JOIN: All fashion and textile enthusiast\nFee: 5000/-\nMaterial will be provide(inclusive of Lunch and Tea)\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Phulkari of Punjab", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/phulkari-of-punjab/1859705654355645", "address": "Craft Village, 19B, Shivji Marg, Westend Green Farms, Rangpuri, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/bannerspace/794aa5f54aba9b5cdd0b066078d20261"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/craft-village/5261171", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/481504451962990/picture?type=large", "events_count": "12", "name": "Craft Village", "followers_count": "61"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-09 10:00:00", "end": "2017-12-10 10:00:00"}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.53134", "longitude": "77.12329"}},

Leveraging tech to improve teacher effectiveness, or improve knowledge sharing, sharing of best practices etc.\n2.) Creating platform where users can upload or create content in vernacular languages.\n3.) Creating tech-enabled reading assessment frameworks or apps.\n\nBuilding on the identified problem statements, opportunity areas for tech-based reading interventions have been clearly delineated:\n1.) Continuous teacher training as well as make sharing of knowledge possible and easy.\n2.) Organic repository for teaching best practiceswith a focus on early grade learning.\n3.) More collaborative and cooperative learning amongst peers/teachers.\n4.) Allow not just authors, but also children (or for that matter anyone) to write or audio-recordand upload stories in regional and local Indian languages.\n5.) Curation of stories in various Indian languages for pre-primary and primary school going children\n6.) Create an EdTech solution which can be used by teachers in low-income classrooms to identify current learning levels.\n7.)Create an EdTech solution to administer diagnostic assessments &amp; enable smooth data collection.\n8.) Create an EdTech solution that takes in child-wise question-wise data and visualizes relevant analysis and provides a road map for remediation.\n9.)

When you open up your Kundalini your creativity and energy increases and your power to manifest yourself in life grows. With that comes a deep responsibility to be true to your core values and your heart.\n\n\n\nTanmaya\n\nLiving from the heart\n\nWe as women are the custodians of love, women are connected to the creation principle. God is love and love is god. Naturally we are centered in our heart, where love, self love and compassion resides. In this session we will explore how we can open the heart and trust into life with totality and nurture the life we want. Through powerful meditations we can expand our love and also access the healing qualities of our heart, which naturally transforms poison into nectar.\n\nSacred Theatre\n\nplayfulness and creativity hold a magic key to tap into the present moment. In this realm we become the co creator with the divine. Sacred theatre is an ancient form of art, where we can embody divinity, archetypes and the divine transmission. Together we will co create a theatrical expression like dance, performance, theatre, mime or similar and experience magic. Life is Leela \u2013 the divine play.\n\nSensorial Awakening\n\nOur senses are doorways into bliss. All our 5 senses are not only there to communicate and get in touch with the world around us but also to get in touch with the world within us. A woman\u2019s body is extremely sensitive but we learned to desensitize ourselves in order not to feel too much. Through opening and healing our outer senses we can heal and access more pleasure within the state of oneness is easily achieved when all our senses are wide open.\n\nThe woman as a healer and psychic\n\nWomen are born psychic by nature, in early days they were the guides of the tribes as channels, oracles, healers and midwifes. With love and playfulness we are going to open up your natural psychic gifts of intuition so you can live your life connected with spirit. Learn how to get in tune with your own body and listen to your inner voice. This is will give you a whole new set of tools to access and experience life.\n\n\n\nTarisha\n\nMahamudra with Live Music - Tanmaya and Tarisha\n\nMahamudra is a Tantra term, which means the great gesture arising out of the orgasm with the universe. Describing the enlightenment as a merging with the whole. Our female spirituality is to disappear into oneness with all there is. This wonderful meditation using the methods of Latihan to become empty and prayer to receive the divine is a true pearl that opens you to the divine and be filled by it. We are having the rare fortune to have this powerful meditation accompanied by live music. Tarisha and her musicians will be tuned into the moment making this an unforgettable experience of the beyond.\n\nWoman appreciating woman\n\nOne wound we as women carry is one of not being seen, recognised and appreciated by other women. They may be scared of their own light, power or beauty and therefore cannot fully welcome those qualities in another. This can show as jealousy, resentment or negative judgements and it hurts. We need to move into a time of collaboration, support and deep care for one another, celebrating each other's qualities, learning from each other, honouring the gifts that each woman brings. Using the cauldron of shamanism, we will create a ceremony where first we give our shame and fear to the FIRE, call in clarity (AIR) so that we can see ourselves and others clearly, fully embody the qualities we recognise in ourselves using dance (EARTH) and finally with the ease of WATER, love and appreciate all that we see manifest in each woman.\n\n\n\nIrene Sposetti\n\nContact Dance Classes \u201cElemental Forces \"\n\n-Body Awareness, Contact Improvisation Technique, Experiential Anatomy, Touch and Voice - The sessions will develop through movement investigations, individual/ partnering/ group exercises, dance improvisation scores, verbal sharing and group reflections.

As wise alchemist then, aware and creative, playfully dancing with all elements, their particular densities and dynamics. Yin and Yang interlaced as complementary forces at play, revealing our authenticity and untamed natural beauty.\n\n\nCaroline Pontual\n\nTantric yoga flow\n\nIn the first phase of this class, we stimulate the body through a creative activating vinyasa sequence in order to awaken the body and stimulate the prana (lifeforce energy) to flow. In the second phase, we explore static postures in order to cultivate and direct the energy flow ( prana or spiritual energy) to certain areas of the body. This System includes yogic tools such as asana, bandhas, mudra, pranayama, mantra, meditation, laya yoga and other components. The practice is directed toward the attainment of the \u201cpromise of yoga\u201d to live free and empowered in order to experience the realization of the purpose of life.\n\nYin yoga\n\nIt's a introspective practice that invites meditation, self awareness, calmness and relaxation. The postures a held for long periods, removing tension in the connective tissues, stimulating the nadis ( meridians) on the body and releasing emotions. This practice invites you to drop into the bliss of surrender and relaxation it is as well an excellent practice for those feeling tired, stressed or over stimulated\n\n\nSukhvinder Sircar\n\nThe 3 Goddesses\n\n\nMa Kali\n\nGoddess of Truth Revolution\n\n\u201cWhere is this brilliant lady, this black light beyond luminosity?\n\nThough I have never seen her, simply hearing her name,\n\nthe mind becomes absorbed completely in her astonishing reality.\n\nOm Kali! Om Kali! Om Kali!\n\n- Ramprasad Sen\n\nWhat is it like to experience the fierce love of the Goddess in battle? She sports in the end times.\n\nToday, we all are in the deep churning cauldron of Kali. To know her is to love her. What would it be like to surrender our shadows, our bondages, our karmic blocks, our fears over to her? That\u2019s nothing that is hidden from her. It takes courage to invite her in, but when you do, you receive her precious gift of freedom. She is fierce wisdom and liberating grace.\n\nIf it is Order you are looking for, she\u2019s the one for you. Kali teaches now for each one of us to come into our deepest integrity and highest truth.

She is divine wisdom, creative expression and sacred sound. She is the mother of all mantras, songs and speech. Every alphabet of Sanskrit contains cosmic mysteries.\n\nDeep inside of us is embedded the creative impulse. Knowing Ma Saraswati is an entry into conscious creation. As we become increasingly conscious (self-realised), we open to deeper levels of creativity (self-expression), and ultimately our role as conscious co-creators emerges.\n\nWhen you know her, she fires your inspiration and creativity. As the \u2018the flowing one\u2019, she nourishes the mind and intellect with purity and grace.\n\nCome and join for an experiential introduction to Ma Saraswati, who initiates our creativity.

Her current focus is on Sexual Ecstasy at Any Age. She spends a great amount of her time learning about Radical Life Extension.\n\nLIN HOLMQUIST\n\nLin started her spiritual journey early in life. With her home deep in the swedish forests it was natural to her to find the shamanistic path and to learn how to listen to the animated life in the wilderness in the woods. She started the practise of yoga during her first pregnancy and discovered a pain free and exstatic delivery. This discovery led her to a deep fascination and admiration of the female body and its powers. Her journey brought her to India where she studied yoga, therapy and tantra with scholars, nuns and mystics for a few years.

Besides controlling electronic sounds, he is a live visual artist that acts as a musician. This happens because JAM is on stage pressing buttons, rotating knobs and turntables in sync with the band as if he is one of the musicians, but more than sounds, his actions also influence the visual art on screen. This way JAM can improvise visually or even create a visual unison with the band, having the knowledge and proficiency of a musician but reaching out to new mediums with his visual art output.\n\nFar-removed from the traditional role of a singer, M (a TC-Helicon ambassador) has created an innovative place for live looping by incorporating it in the band. That and the use of effects, wordless songs, vocal improvisation and looping textures augment the potential way by which this singer can intervene with the music and express herself making it possible to also act as an instrument.\n\nIn a nutshell, this project is shaping the future of performances when it comes to roles and possibilities within musical settings.\n\nThis event is supported by the Portuguese Embassy of New Delhi and Cam\u00f5es I.P.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Mn'JAM experiment at Akshara Theater", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/mnjam-experiment-at-akshara-theater/267068050485698", "address": "Akshara Theater, Baba Kharak Singh Marg, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/1d742c72af1555f47566f31d097de16a"], "organizer": {}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-07 20:30:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.625832131187", "longitude": "77.203344746695"}},

When love lets us down, we release heat around the heart, which then freezes and forms a layer around the organ. The subtle ego isolates us further and forbids us from accessing our feelings.\n\nLove is possible when the relation is complete, not before. Sexuality is possible, intense attraction is possible, but always in waves of love-hate. There is a common misconception that love has something to do with someone else. This comes from a place of self-hate. Love, on the other, is pure positivity. To see the preciousness of everyone is to be in love.\n\nA realized relationship is one in which two people don\u2019t need anything from each other, but acquire enormous joy by giving and receiving from themselves. We must also be open to giving and receiving equally. Love can only flow between equals. And the human heart has the impulse to connect with the pulse of other hearts.\n\nThe workshop is going to be experienced as a specific body-work. We will work in couples, alternating the active and the receptive part, applying pressure to different points that are in direct contact with the nervous system. We will pulse the heart, the center of our emotions, and the other points of the nervous system connected to the heart. With the help of a partner, we will transform and let go of our tensions: the very essence of Tantra.\n\nFacilitator Bio : Parambodhi \n\nArchitect and painter, Parambodhi began his spiritual journey in the 70s after his encounter with his master Osho. He lived in the Osho commune since 1981 to 1985, in Milano, Zurich, Berlin and Rajneeshpuram, Oregon.\n\nHe was introduced to Tibetan Pulsing by Shantam Dheeraj in the 90s. From 1992 to 1997 in Poona, he received from Dheeraj the transmission of the various levels of Tibetan Pulsing. In 1998 in Bagni di Lucca, Italy, from the last teachings from Dheeraj.\n\nHe has being working the last 20 years in Italy, Germany, Greece, Russia, India, at individual levels and in groups as a process.

Learn how you can live a life of abundance in all areas of life.\n\nThe workshop starts with a 45 minute video about Jonathan Langley's life. Once a successful painter and printmaker, Jonathan now lives in complete darkness, rarely leaving his apartment and is angry at the world.

Lupe leads him to a fresh perspective by showing him the power of kindness, compassion, and love.\n\nOutcome\n\nOnce we have taken an idea on how the subconscious mind works along with the power of the spoken word, we shall learn the technique of declaring our future wants and desires. This is a way of affirming for a life you really wish to create.\n\nCome to create life in a positive way\n\nWorkshop focus\n\nWhat are affirmations &amp; how they effect us\nThe secret behind the secret\nHow to write a new story for myself &amp; The power of declaration\n\n\nFacilitator Bio:\n\nAsmah D\u2019souza is a Life Coach and Corporate Mentor who conducts Workshops on ESQ (enhance the spiritual quotient), EIQ (Empower Integrity quotient), Positivity and Productivity Enhancement, Train-the-Trainer.

Who would believe that, even in independent India, children are bought and sold, to slog as cheap labour, in a city like Allahabad, which gave to India one Prime Minister after another? Parveen Talha\u2019s earlier book Fida-e-Lucknow (a collection of short stories published by Niyogi Books), steeped in the textures and flavours of Lucknow, brought alive the city and its people for her readers.In the current volume she has widened her canvas and made it more colourful, with characters from Lucknow and its adjoining towns and villages, playing vibrant roles on a stage shifting through time and space, portraying the rich history of the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb. In this book her stories open many unknown pages of history, and bring back forgotten memories of folklore, of not only Lucknow but the whole of Awadh. With the bygone era, the present times also come alive.We take great pleasure in inviting you to the unveiling of our latest title \u201cA Word Thrice Uttered' on Tuesday, 5th December, 2017  at 6:00 pm at Seminar Hall I II &amp; III, Kamla Devi Complex, India International Centre.We request you to kindly grace the event with your presence.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Book Launch of The Word Thrice Uttered | Niyogi Books", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/book-launch-of-the-word-thrice-uttered-|-niyogi-books/80008586102326", "address": "India International Centre, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn2.allevents.in/thumbs/thumb5a152b931c14f.png"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/pr-niyogibooks/10877923", "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jAmTruiEOUE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/MPofihgXYrY/photo.jpg?sz=200", "events_count": "0", "name": "Pr Niyogibooks", "followers_count": "0"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-05 18:00:00", "end": "2017-11-27 19:00:00"}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.593457145767", "longitude": "77.222418783666"}},

Garnering a growing chorus of rave reviews, Poor Agnes will finally have its premiere in India!\n\nPoor Agnes features '\u201dstunning central performances from Lora Burke as the insane Agnes and Robert Notman as Mike, this is one serial killer film that should be held in the same regard as  Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, American Psycho and, yes, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.\u201d (Nerdly.co.uk)\n\nSynopsis:\nAgnes Poelzl is a vicious psychopath. She lives in a state of dreamy contemplation, her powerful mind twisted by insanity. Her talent, discipline and focus are impressive, but her desires have led her down a path of violence and M**der.\n\nMike Mercer is a private investigator researching a cold case. When his investigation leads him to Agnes, he has no idea what he's getting himself into. Agnes seduces, captures, and locks Mike in her basement. She then begins a regimen of brutal psychological torture meant to brainwash him into a state of total compliance.\n\nChris Thomas is a computer technician who finds himself dating Agnes. He gets the sense that something is off with her, but her forwardness sweeps him off his feet. She is surprisingly tender with him at first, until she grows bored. Agnes then drags Chris into her nightmare.\n\nAgnes, Mike and Chris form a bizarre family, with Agnes as the twisted matriarch lording over her captives with regal authority. Mike struggles to keep his soul as Agnes's willpower overwhelms him, while Chris begs to stay alive. No matter how grim the outlook is, Agnes always makes things worse. But as her crimes escalate, Agnes finds it increasingly difficult to avoid the police.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Multi-award winning film Poor Agnes premieres in India at DIFF!", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/multi-award-winning-film-poor-agnes-premieres-in-india-at-diff/1670696796283692", "address": "Connaught Place - CP,Delhi, Heart of New Delhi, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/f02748635147be95840981d187b008b4-rimg-w200-h200-gmir"], "organizer": {}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-05 19:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.63215420804", "longitude": "77.21917048647"}},

Its music consists of original compositions, achieving a distinctive sound due to the fusion of different music genres such as flamenco, tango, jazz, classical music, progressive and experimental.  \n\nCelebrating the 5th anniversary of the band, Felah-Enkum has programmed a tour around Japan, India &amp; Mexico in 2017, performing as a duo in which Jorge De Llano takes care of the guitars (Lead and Rhythmic) and Gerardo Raigoza of the percussions.   \n\nFelah-Enkum Project had emerged in 2012 from the enthusiasm of Jorge De Llano (Lead Guitar &amp; Rhythmic Guitar), who experimented back then with new sounds added to flamenco rumba, and who started to make small compositions and/or musical experimentations mixing flamenco with progressive rock/metal. It was then when he set the foundations of what would be the peculiar and innovative style that distinguishes Felah-Enkum\u2019s music.  \n\nDuring 2013, Felah-Enkum released its first album called \u201cproject\u201d under the Premier Records Inc. label from Los \u00c1ngeles, California, with which the band signed a contract on October 2013 and received excellent critic and acceptance worldwide, especially in Asia and Europe, \n\nIn December 2014, Felah-Enkum Project made its first tour around Japan. They offered five concerts in Tokyo, where the band was received with excellent critic, reaffirming their success in the country. In 2015, Felah Enkum signed a contract with the worldwide recognized Spanish brand of guitars Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Guitars. \n\nNowadays, the band is promoting its second album, which was released during its second tour around Japan in November-December 2015.

He was awarded a diploma with merit at Sir Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in the UK. His strong interest in his Latin roots coupled with his passion for jazz led him to study at the Escola Superior de M\u00fasica e Artes do Espect\u00e1culo in Portugal, where he graduated in jazz piano with an award for outstanding achievement, bestowed upon him by Rotary Club Porto-Foz in 2015. During his course, he was also awarded a merit grant to study Brazilian music at UNICAMP \u2013 Universidade Estadual de Campinas (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil).\nHe has attended workshops coached by musicians such as Kevin Hays, Scott Colley, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Jorge Rossy, Chick Corea and C\u00e9sar Camargo Mariano. He has co-directed musicals, performed with orchestras and big bands, and starred as both a pianist and composer in projects in countries such as the UK, France, Finland, Germany, Spain, Greece and the USA. \nIn January 2016, he recorded his debut album \u201cSuite Tr\u00eas Rios\u201d in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with musicians such as Jaques Morelenbaum, Ricardo Silveira, Teco Cardoso, Rafael Barata and Leila Pinheiro. It peaked at #1 on the iTunes Jazz Chart and Top 10 across all genres in Portugal, prior to hitting the #1 slot on the CMJ Top Adds Chart in the USA.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Registrations for Boli Punjabi are now closed -- please stay tuned for future events. :)\n\nBoli is an initiative to help people connect with their native languages or other Indian languages they are interested in, with small, guided discussion groups. Attendance is free - your enthusiastic participation is all we want. :)\n\nAs Indians, we are often lucky to speak more than one language. However, a lot of us want to read in, write in and engage with in our native languages, but don\u2019t know where to start. Reading a book in a language you are not used to reading in, even if you speak it natively, can be intimidating. Writing can be even scarier. But we know there is a whole world of unexplored literature, poetry, music and film out there that we have the means of accessing.\n\nWe\u2019re so close, and yet so far, from discovering this world. We have the potential to be truly skilled in our own languages. Boli helps you overcome the unfamiliarity with your native language, or indeed, any Indian language you know. We do this by creating a meet with other people like you, and an expert in your language, so you can start this wonderful exploration with friends and guides.\n\nImagine: You are in a bookstore, surrounded by books, in a small group of people who are as excited about Punjabi as you are. Ajay Gulzar, someone who has extraordinary insight into Punjabi literature and culture, starts out by reading a poem, or a small extract, in Punjabi. You understand and discuss this reading as a group. It is followed by a whirlwind of being introduced to songs, films and literature in Punjabi -- and you end up learning not only an important part of the culture, but also some of the history of Punjab, its movements, its traditions and its revolutions. \n\nIf you are able to read Punjabi, you slowly build on the workshops to move on to reading and writing on your own. Recommendations fly thick and fast and help is always right next to you. You know where to look for good authors. You start discovering quirks in the language. You even have favourite quotes. Soon, you know that the next time you casually pick up a book to read, it could be in Punjabi. If you cannot read Punjabi, that is fine -- we are happy to simply introduce you to an unexplored world!\n\nSounds like a fun weekend activity?

This is a story of an ordinary woman, a mother of three sons, who tries to keep her family intact amongst everything that is happening around them. This play shows the internal conflicts and turmoil prevailing in an ordinary Indian family with the struggle for freedom, social beliefs of those times and the partition. Beleaguered in different convictions, values and aspirations of her sons and husband, Jamuna, the protagonist of the play, is a representative of quintessential Indian women and mothers. The play, which is full of Indian music, is a ride into various emotions and dramatic elements like love, betrayal, hope, patriotism, comedy and poetry.\n\nCast &amp; Creatives\u2013Writer &amp; director \u2013Atul Satya Koushik Artist \u2013 Avatar Gill.\n\nProduced By : Coconut Theatre &amp; The Film &amp; Theatre Society\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Wo Lahore", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/wo-lahore/109277243187201", "address": "Kamani Auditorium, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/266d51c1a584dceda206248469aa5383-rimg-w200-h200-gmir"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/coconut-theatre/11739334", "image": "https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/7022b630a2f39a57d3f2e60b495b063f.jpeg", "events_count": "2", "name": "Coconut Theatre", "followers_count": "2"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-02 17:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.6552737", "longitude": "77.1465829"}},

Cultural Heritage is often expressed as either Intangible or Tangible Cultural Heritage.\n-\tIntangible Heritage refers to those aspects of a country that cannot be touched or seen. For example traditional music, folklore, language etc.\n-\tTangible Heritage refers to those significant places that advocate the country\u2019s history and culture. For example monuments, mosques, shrines, monasteries etc. \n\nThe objectives of this lecture are:-\n1-\tTo discuss the need to preserve our cultural heritage\n2-\tTo explain the types of cultural heritage\n3-\tUnderstanding the significance or importance of cultural heritage.\n4-\tContribution of cultural heritage in tourism in India.\n5-\tRole of govt.

He started his career as a Software Engineer and reached the level of top management in less than a decade. He has designed solutions for brands like Samsung, Coke, Pepsi, HP, Apollo, Nestle, Airtel, Microsoft and many more. His work left him with 25+ awards, including two international mentions. His 14 years in the IT sector inspired him to develop techniques to study history through modern day technology.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     REProduce Listening Showcase at Akshara Theatre\nSaturday, 2nd December 2017, 4-9 PM\n\n**Donor Passes available at the door at INR300**\n\nOn Saturay, December 2nd, New Delhi based music collective REProduce Artists will bring their Listening Room back to Akshara Theatre.  Located in central Delhi, the complex dates back to the early seventies - a structure meticulously well preserved in wood and stone, and host to many events, but, rarely music.  With the gracious assistance of Red Bull, we are thrilled to produce this space in the way we do.\n\nAs always, the series aims to fill a gap in the ever iterating and increasingly varied community of live music in India by showcasing talent that might not get heard in the more mainstream oriented venues. REProduce Listening Room focuses purely on the music \u2013 in a space where an audience can absorb sound on their own terms.\n\nFor this event, we will focus on the indoors of the space, with a primary showcase of the indoor Katha Theatre - an acoustically treated arena fringed with balconies, wood, and history.\n\n\nKomorebi (New Delhi, India)\n\nTarana and I met outside an LR session at Exhibit 320 just over a year ago when she was collaborating with Corridors.  Having expressed an interest to perform with us then, we soon saw her do just that - but over the course of three performances, I personally have experienced (at least as far as what memory serves) as three completely different performances, all of which were executed by her, and her alone.  For this performance - something we have been wanting to do for some time - we are very excited to continue this tradition.  She will present a body of work that involves her talent as a pianist, accompanied by a vocal choir arrangement.\n\nSahil Vasudeva (New Delhi, India)\n\nTrained classically and now bringing an entirely different take on his pedigree, Sahil has made it his objective to merge the finesse of someone who can play Debussy and Ravel with a sort of exploration in character dynamics and dialogue that renders the vulnerability of a performer even more visceral.  Since last summer, he has been refining an execution he calls an un-recital\u201d - an execution that merges photographic study, recorded dialogue, a series of props, and vintage Indian television commercials - woven together into a singular whole by his peerless talent as a pianist, and a past deeply involved in theatre and drama.\n\na maze (New Delhi, India)\n\nNishant makes synths. He goes to Old Delhi and finds what he needs and he just does it, and I don\u2019t really understand what or how he does it, and I don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve seen him deploy wind up rabbits, radios, and Ruhail, attack a piece of sheet metal with a bandsaw while putting mics on it, sustain an hour with Infnite Jar Space of complete synaesthesia, and set a PA on fire.  The latter was, of course, \u201cunintentional\u201d.\n\nDualist Inquiry (New Delhi, India)\n\nIn speaking to Sahej and coming to grips with just how deep the lineage of his focus on creating music can be traced, it should come as little surprise to look back his past seven years and what he\u2019s been able to achieve.  Sahej may have gone to California to study the music business with a guitar in hand, but he\u2019d soon bear witness to just how powerful electronic music can be to an audience.  Seeing what was brewing here in Delhi towards the end of the naughties forged a clear path for what he would do post his studies, and anyone who has paid some attention to live music here in India can recognise his contributions since.  For this performance, we are very excited to showcase him in a different context - a semi-improvised live set of unreleased material, studio experiments and works in progress - performed with hardware synthesiers and live instruments.\n\nSISTER (Leh, India)\n\nRuhail\u2019s first performance as SISTER was almost eighteen months ago to date.  Since then, he\u2019s played LR sessions multiple times as well as the DISQUIET series curated by Hemant SK, and along the way he has generated disgust, repulsion, a physical seizure, and a complete and utter command of your attention.  His work draws upon black metal tropes but takes it to places rarely - if ever - visited, and his performances display a rare conviction of deploying his vision, as well as a healthy disregard for the consequences.\n\nDisco Puppet (Bangalore, India)\n\nWith two releases out this year, a number of commissions to score theatrical productions in India and Singapore, and musical performances across both China and closer to home, Shoumik has clearly had a productive year.  As a live performer, his work deploys live drumming and software sequencing, but also a sort of disassociated take on vocals.  And sometimes a flute.  He rarely has the chance to perform in Delhi, so consider this a small taste of what the peerless Consolidate label roster has to offer.\n\n\n\nFor more information please visit: \n\nAkshara Theatre: aksharatheatre.com\nREProduce Artists: instagram.com/reproduceartists\nListening Room: win.gs/2iqDjpX\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "REProduce Delhi | Listening Showcase", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/reproduce-delhi-|-listening-showcase/665097670545002", "address": "Akshara Theater, Baba Kharak Singh Marg, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/99c139a76e3a79cfad97157c0cc51667.jpeg"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/reproduce-artists/323700", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/191189701004807/picture?type=large", "events_count": "4", "name": "REProduce Artists", "followers_count": "29"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-02 16:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.625832131187", "longitude": "77.203344746695"}},

Do register your vehicle with the organizers before the ride starts incase you have a personal security vehicle. We are posting this ride early as we are expecting a lot of riders from all over the country to be a part of this Epic Brevet and they need to plan their trip to Delhi. The links to the rides are as followes:- The rules are :- \n\nRules and instructions for Delhi Randonneurs Brevets.\n\n1. The 'Delhi Randonneurs Brevets' cycling event is being organized by Delhi Randonneurs and its authorized representatives, herewith referred as 'Delhi Randonneurs' or 'the Organizers'.\n\n2. These brevets are open to any amateur cyclist, above 18 years in age, regardless of his or her cycling affiliations.\n\n3. Any form of human-powered vehicle is acceptable. The only stipulation is that the vehicle must be powered solely by the rider.\n\n4. To participate in a brevet a rider must complete a registration form and pay a registration fee set by Delhi Randonneurs along with signing a waiver of Liabilities.\n\n5. During the event, each rider is considered to be on a personal ride. The rider must ride in accordance with all applicable traffic codes and obey all traffic signals.\n\n6. The Delhi Randonneurs, organizers and its representatives cannot and do not accept responsibility for any accidents that may occur before, during and post event (result of event).\n\n7. For night riding, vehicles must be equipped with front and rear lights attached firmly to the vehicle. Lights must be fully functional at all times (Spare lights are strongly recommended; spare bulbs are required). At least one of the rear lights must be in a steady (rather than flashing) mode. Riders not complying with all these requirements will not be permitted to start.\n\n8. Lights must be on from dusk to dawn and at any other times when poor visibility conditions exist (rain, fog, etc.). Each rider, whether riding in a group or by himself, must fully comply with this requirement. Everyone must use their lights! All riders must wear a reflective vest, sash, Sam Browne belt, or some other device that clearly places reflective material on the front and back of the rider.\n\n9. Any violation of these night riding rules will result in the immediate disqualification of the rider.\n\n10. Each rider must be self sufficient. No follow cars or support of any kind are permitted on the course. Personal support is only allowed at checkpoints. Any violation of this requirement will result in immediate disqualification.\n\n11. At the start, though the organizer may create groups, as everyone rides at his or her own pace, a rider could go out the group at any time. No rider can be considered as group leader. All distinctive signs (jersey,armband, etc\u2026) or title (road captain) to indicate superiority are not allowed. All riders are required to conduct themselves in a civil manner and abide by all applicable vehicle codes, laws, and regulations. All riders are required to respect local customs with regards to decorum.\n\n12. At the start, each rider will receive a DR Brevet Card and a cue sheet indicating the route and the location of the checkpoints. Riders must stay on the route. If a rider leaves the route, they must return to the route at the same point prior to continuing, ie. no shortcuts or detours from the route, unless specified by the organizer. Riders must stop at each checkpoint to have their card stamped. Organizers may also include unannounced checkpoints along the route. This assures that everyone will stay on the prescribed route.\n\n13. The Organizers may have checkpoints with no member of the organizing staff present. At these checkpoints riders must get their DR Brevet Card stamped at a local establishment that the organizer specifies as a checkpoint, such as a grocery store or gas station. Checkpoint information to be noted on the DR Brevet Card includes the time and the date of passage (for brevets that extend beyond 24 hours).\n\n14. Missing checkpoint stamps, missing checkpoint times, or loss of the DR Brevet Card (regardless of how far into the ride a rider is) will result in disqualification. Each rider is responsible for seeing that his DR Brevet Card is properly completed at each checkpoint.\n\n15. Additionally, riders must arrive at each checkpoint between the opening and closing time for the checkpoint. These times are noted on the DR Brevet Card with the information for the checkpoints. Riders must arrive at each checkpoint between the start and the finish while the checkpoint is open. If a rider arrives at a checkpoint after it has closed and the ride organizer is satisfied that the rider's lateness is due to the occurrence of something unforeseen and beyond the control of the rider (such as stopping to help at a traffic accident or a road closure), then the ride organizer may waive the fact that the rider arrived at the control late and allow the rider to continue. Poor bicycle or equipment maintenance, fatigue, lack of fitness, hunger, etc. are not unforeseen and beyond the control of the rider and therefore will not serve as a valid reason for being late. Subject to the foregoing, failure to make all checkpoints, even if the brevet is done within the overall time limit, will result in disqualification.\n\n16. Any fraud, cheating, or deliberate violation of these rules may result in the exclusion of the rider from all Delhi Randonneurs sponsored events.\n\n17. At the finish, the rider must sign his DR Brevet Card and return it to the event organizer.\n\n18. These rides are not competitive events, so no rider classifications are made.\n\n19. While taking part in a Delhi Randonneurs Brevets, the riders accept the publication of their identity and the time achieved in the results published by the organizers. Their identity will never be used at commercial purposes or to be transmitted to a third party for this purpose.\n\n20. Any rider who registers for and Joins the Delhi Randonneurs brevets agrees by these actions to the following: Any complaint or question concerning the event or its organization must be submitted to the organizer in writing, within 48 hours from the finish of the event.\n\nSo now get going, give a commitment to yourself and get registered\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Brevet LOC 1000, 6th Edition", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/brevet-loc-1000-6th-edition/342766759478042", "address": "Delhi, India, New Delhi, India, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/c499ef22a31e5f3648219bb49c365ff0"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/chiro-mitra/3618546", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/10152432423114225/picture?type=large", "events_count": "7", "name": "Chiro Mitra", "followers_count": "157"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-12-02 05:30:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.612863888889", "longitude": "77.229305555556"}},

As the body fades away, the film begins to take shape.\n\nThe film starts on the eve on Mr. Aich\u2019s 101st birthday. Mr. Aich\u2019s insistence on not remembering anything about his life is where the idea of the film germinates \u2013 to consciously move away from the evidential burden of a \u2018biopic\u2019 towards an intimate portrait - A story that transcends time to reveal the oddities that make human stories worth telling.\n\nThe film has been shot over a period two years. The complex interpersonal relationships formed during the filming become the lens through which we try to evoke the time that has passed and perhaps get a perspective of what an individual\u2019 passionate obsession (or idiosyncrasy?) might mean.\n\nAbout the director -\nPrateek is an independent filmmaker and writer based out Mumbai/Goa. A graduate of the film direction course from Film &amp; Television Institute of India, he has been working on both fiction as well as non-fiction films. This is his first feature length film. His films include After Dark, Kasbe Ka Cinema Manager, Kal, 15th August, Dukaan Bandh Rahegi, and Re- Tracing Freedom: Goa.

KRUNK has pioneered the bass music movement in India for the last 7 years.\n\n--------------------\nAbout Om Unit\n--------------------\nAs a producer and DJ, Om Unit (Jim Coles) has been a significant and pioneering presence in various dance music circles for the past five years. Following a formative decade in the global hip-hop underground, Coles took the name Om Unit in the late 2000s and began to travel across genres and scenes in search of sonic tropes to cross-breed and re-imagine. In the early 2010s, he came to pioneer the stylistic and rhythmic links between jungle and footwork via a series of acclaimed edits that brought him to the attention of the drum &amp; bass scene. This personal approach has earned Coles praise as a refreshing voice in dance music from both peers and the media. His debut album was, 2013\u2019s Threads, and he's worked with legendary drum &amp; bass outfit Metalheadz, Machinedrum, Grammy-winning producer Om\u2019Mas Keith, Plastician\u2019s Terrorhythm, Sam Binga and more. In 2011, Coles set up a label, Cosmic Bridge Records, through which he has exercised an A&amp;R sensibility that has created an exciting independent home for likeminded artists. Coles is also a sought after DJ, with over 300 appearances in clubs and festivals in more than 30 countries he has made the equivalent of over a dozen trips round the globe and counting. And in line with his desire to imagine new potentials for dance music has appeared on varied bills from the Montreux Jazz Festival to Bass Coast, Outlook to Mysteryland.\n\n----------------------\nAbout KUTMAH\n----------------------\nA mercurial creative, whether you\u2019re talking art or music. As a DJ/curator, he has tirelessly searched for and championed new underground talent from across the globe.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     The word \"Qawwali\" is derived from the Arabic word \"Qaol\" which means \"axiom\" or \"dictum\". Qawwali is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in the Indian subcontinent. It is a vibrant musical tradition that stretches back more than 750 years. The roots of Qawwali can be traced back from 8th century in Persia (today's Iran and Afghanistan). During the first major migration from Persia, in the 11th century, the musical tradition of Sema migrated to the Indian subcontinent, Turkey and Uzbekistan.\n\nAmir Khusro Dehelvi of the Chisti order of Sufis is credited with fusing the Persian and South Asian musical traditions to create Qawwali as we know it today in the late 13th century in India (Hindustani classical music is also attributed to him). Hazarat Amir Khusro trained 12 (twelve) children for performing qawwalies ,these children are known as \"Qawwal Bachche\" and the families associated with these Qawwal Bachche are known as \"Qawwal Bachchon Ka Gharana\" (The house hold of Qawwal Bachche).\n\nMian Samad Bin Ibrahim was the first pupil of Hazrat Ameer Khusro and the Group Leader of the team, formed by Hazrat Ameer Khusro called \"Qawwal Bachoon Ka Gharana\".\n\nUstad Tan Ras Khan Sahab (founder of Delhi Gharana) who was a teacher of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar , is direct descendant of Amir Khusro\u2019s principal disciple Mian Samad Bin Ibrahim.\n\nNizami Khusro Brothers \u200bare\u200b the most senior amongst the descendents (4th Generation) of Tan Ras Khan Sahib belongs to this well known Qawwal Bachchon Ka Gharana as well as \"Delhi Gharana\". His family has been singing Qawwalis for past eight centuries. Khusro's tradition has passed unbroken across seven centuries and thirty generations. 'Nizami Khusro Brothers ', current head of the Qawwal Bachche as well as Delhi Gharana, still sings in Delhi.\nNizami Khusro Brothers  is well versed and can perform in several languages such as Ar\u200ba\u200bbic, Persian, Hindi, Urdu, etc. Ustad Meraj Nizami has total mastery over various genres of classical music, such as Dhrupad, Khayal, Tarana, Thumri and Dadra, which he blends beautifully during his performances of Qawwali.\n\nNizami Khusro Brothers started \u200btheir\u200b training in classical music at a\u200b very\u200b tender age under the rigorous and critical tutelage of \u200btheir\u200b late father, Ustad Yaqub Ali Khan (Piarey Khan Sahib). Regula Burckhardt Qureshi wrote a book about sufi music \"Sufi Music of India and Pakistan\" \u200b the s\u200bound, context and meaning in Qawwali. Although she had number of informants , Qureshi dedicates much of her presentation to the one \u200bm\u200busician : Nizami Khusro Brothers .\n\nUstad Meraj Ahmed Nizami sings the superb poetry of Sultan Quli Qtub Shah (d.1543 A.D.) , Roshnara begum (1617-1671) the daughter of Mughal Emperor Shahjahan . If any one want to listen true or pure form of qawwaali The Khusro Nizami Brothers headed by renowed qawwal Nizami Khusro Brothers is the right group . \u200bI\u200bf any one want to know the soul of sufi music : Nizami Khusro Brothers the only name that can be trusted.

While policies and programs on urbanisation have gained strength in the last decade or so and focus is also shifting to the smaller cities and towns of India, it is important to get back to the basics of who we are planning for. The human angle would need to be deeply re-examined and brought back into the core of the planning debate. While technology solutions and tools would enable us to plan and manage better it would be critical to ensure the cross sectoral integration and the effectiveness of planning.

{"tickets": {}, "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Around 800 million women are expected to enter the global economy over 2012-2022. This third billion \u2013as significant as that of the billion-plus populations of India and China \u2013 will play a considerable role in countries around the world. However, data in India and across the world shows that women are significantly under-represented in leadership positions.  \n\nIn 2017, India ranked third lowest for the third year consecutively in the leadership roles held by women . Only 17% of senior roles were held by women in India and 41% of the Indian businesses surveyed had no women in leadership roles. \n\nEven in the not profit sector, which is often perceived as a domain for women, women constituted close to 53% of employees across designations and only 34% in managerial positions . The percentage of women in managerial or higher-ranked positions varied based on which gender heads the NGO. In women-led organizations, 75% of female employees had managerial roles, whereas only 15% of female employees had managerial roles in men-led organizations. Similarly, an international study of 1,000 non-profit organizations showed that only 43% of non-profit organizations had women CEOs, which reduced to 18% in the largest non-profits . \n\nIn this context, a critical question becomes: What can organizations do to ensure that the third billion realizes its potential? This moderated discussion aims to share the experiences of eminent women in leadership positions to provide insights on:\n- What were the challenges faced by them as young and mid-career academics, professionals, advocates/ campaigners and how these were navigated?\n- What challenges do they face in achieving organizational goals and how are they navigating these?  \n- How are they trying to create gender balanced environments?\t\t\t\t\t\t", "event_name": "Women in Leadership: Challenges and Way Forward", "url": "https://allevents.in/new%20delhi/women-in-leadership-challenges-and-way-forward/319534211883748", "address": "India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, New Delhi, India", "images": ["https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/b75c01eae5112d63b81fb610bb2b52b8.jpeg"], "organizer": {"url": "https://allevents.in/org/columbia-alumni-association-of-india/1838630", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/305576172872698/picture?type=large", "events_count": "1", "name": "Columbia Alumni Association of India", "followers_count": "6"}, "event_date_time": {"start": "2017-11-27 19:00:00", "end": ""}, "geo_details": {"latitude": "28.589695", "longitude": "77.224906"}},
